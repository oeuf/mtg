# Commander Archetype Suite – README

This repo / sheet is a small “Commander lab” built around **four core deck archetypes**, each with **three salt tiers** (power / misery levels).

Target audience: people who already play **Commander / EDH** casually, but want structured options for:
- Playing different *styles* (prison, hatebears, graveyard, big mana),
- Matching deck power to a table,
- Having a clear sense of **who is the villain** and who is trying to keep them in check.

---

## Jargon & Acronym Primer

### Magic / Commander Terms

Very quick definitions so you don’t get lost:

- **EDH / Commander** – 100-card singleton format with a legendary **commander** that sets your color identity.
- **cEDH** – “Competitive EDH”, tuned for fast combo, lots of free interaction, and efficient wins.
- **Archetype** – A deck’s structural identity (e.g. prison, hatebears, goodstuff).
- **Goodstuff** – A deck built mostly from individually strong cards, with light synergy.
- **Stax** – Enchantments / artifacts / creatures that **tax** or **restrict** actions (e.g. “each player can only cast one spell per turn”).
- **Prison** – Heavier stax; goal is to **lock opponents out** of normal play.
- **Pillowfort** – Defensive enchantments that make attacking you expensive or impossible.
- **Hatebears** – Small creatures that carry disruptive static abilities (like Thalia, Gaddock Teeg).
- **Value** – Slowly gaining incremental advantage over time (cards, mana, board).
- **Turbo combo** – Decks that race to assemble a game-winning combo ASAP.
- **Voltron** – Decks that pile buffs on one creature (often the commander) and win via commander damage.
- **Wheels** – Cards that make everyone discard and draw a new hand (Wheel of Fortune, Windfall, etc.).

### Archetype Acronyms (GA4, CA, SU, RGX)

These four tags are **project nicknames** for the archetypes. They’re not official Magic terms, just convenient shorthand:

- **GA4** = **G**rand **A**rbiter Augustin **IV**  
  - Literally the commander’s name compressed: *Grand Arbiter Augustin IV* → **GA4**.  
  - Used for the **Azorius prison / stax** deck.

- **CA** = **C**ontrol–**A**ggro (Bant Hatebears / Blink)  
  - A label for the **Bant hatebears + ETB blink** deck (Roon).  
  - “Control” = stacks of hatebears & interaction; “Aggro” = you win via creature combat and incremental pressure.

- **SU** = **S**ultai **U**tility (Sultai Graveyard Value–Combo)  
  - Tag for the **Muldrotha Sultai graveyard** deck.  
  - “Sultai” is the color combo (B/G/U); “Utility” points at the flexible, toolbox-y value/combo plan.

- **RGX** = **R**amp–**G**rowth–**X**-spells (Simic Lands / Big Mana)  
  - The **Aesi Simic lands/big mana** deck.  
  - “Ramp” + “Growth” = heavy land ramp, “X” = big X-spells / huge-mana finishers.

Whenever you see **GA4 / CA / SU / RGX** in the sheet, it’s referring to one of these four archetypes.

---

## The 4 Archetypes at a Glance

1. **GA4 – Azorius Prison (Grand Arbiter Augustin IV)**  
   - **Colors:** White–Blue (Azorius)  
   - **Role:** Classic **prison / stax** deck. Taxes mana, limits spells, controls combat, then slowly closes the game.
   - **Experience:** “Everything is expensive and nothing untaps.”

2. **CA – Bant Hatebears / Blink (Roon of the Hidden Realm)**  
   - **Colors:** Green–White–Blue (Bant)  
   - **Role:** **Hatebear + ETB (enter-the-battlefield) value** deck. Answers problems with creatures, then blinks them for more value.
   - **Experience:** “You can play, but your deck will run at 60–70% capacity while I flicker value creatures.”

3. **SU – Sultai Graveyard Value–Combo (Muldrotha, the Gravetide)**  
   - **Colors:** Black–Green–Blue (Sultai)  
   - **Role:** **Graveyard engine** that loops permanents, assembles compact combos, and grinds the table out.
   - **Experience:** “Kill my stuff, I’ll just replay it. Also, I might win out of nowhere.”

4. **RGX – Simic Lands / Big Mana (Aesi, Tyrant of Gyre Strait)**  
   - **Colors:** Green–Blue (Simic)  
   - **Role:** **Land-ramp, card draw, big finishers.** Builds huge mana, then overwhelms with tokens or massive spells.
   - **Experience:** “I’ll play extra lands, draw extra cards, and eventually there are 30 power and a Craterhoof.”

---

## Salt Levels

Each archetype has **3 tiers** of power / salt, all using the same core philosophy:

- **Extreme (Ext)** –  
  - Maximal stax, fast mana, efficient tutors, and compact combos.  
  - Skews toward **high-power / pseudo-cEDH** tables, or groups that explicitly consent to misery.  
  - Often includes Reserved List cards, fast mana (Mana Crypt, Moxen), and hard locks.

- **Mid** –  
  - Tuned but not degenerate.  
  - Keeps the **core identity** but trims the harshest locks and some fast mana.  
  - Ideal for **experienced EDH pods** that want real interaction, but not a tournament feel.

- **Low** –  
  - Casual leaning; reduced prison, fewer “feel-bad” combos.  
  - More battlecruiser games, big plays, and social fun.  
  - Good for **newer players, mixed power tables, and larger pods** (4–5+ players).

### When to Use Which

- **Two-player or 1v1+Archenemy**  
  - Ext and Mid prison / combo are more acceptable; you’re not locking three people out.
- **Normal 4-player EDH pod**  
  - Start with **Mid**.  
  - Use **Ext** only if everyone is on the same page.  
  - Use **Low** if people bring precons or light upgrades.
- **Larger groups (5–6+)**  
  - Stick to **Low** or very soft Mid.  
  - Heavy stax in big pods tends to feel miserable.

## Archetype 1: GA4 – Azorius Prison

**Commander:** Grand Arbiter Augustin IV  
**Colors:** White–Blue  
**Name origin:** The deck is structurally built around **GAA4** as a **mana-taxing, spell-taxing commander**. The “GA4” shorthand is a nod to that.

### What GA4 Does

- **Taxes spells and mana** with Grand Arbiter himself and effects like:
  - Thalia variants, Rule of Law, Deafening Silence.
- **Locks down permanents and untap steps**:
  - Winter Orb, Static Orb, Stasis, Hokori, Back to Basics.
- **Pillowforts against combat**:
  - Ghostly Prison, Propaganda, Moat / Magus of the Moat, Sphere of Safety.
- **Wins slowly** via:
  - Planeswalkers (Teferi, Hero of Dominaria), Approach of the Second Sun, token engines, or inevitability via control.

**Design considerations:**

- Heavy on **enchantments and artifacts** → enables Serra’s Sanctum, Hall of Heliod’s Generosity, Academy Ruins.
- Wants a **critical mass of 2-mana rocks** to get ahead on mana before locking the table.
- Extreme versions include:
  - Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale, Nether Void (in off-color shells), Mindslaver locks, Book of Exalted Deeds + Faceless Haven.
- Low versions:
  - Cut mass land destruction, cut hard locks, keep more fair sweepers and political tools.

### What GA4 is Known For

- Being “**the fun police**” at the table.  
- Shutting down **greedy manabases**, **spell-slinger storm**, and **tap-out goodstuff** decks.
- Drawing a lot of **hate and early aggression** if the table knows what’s coming.

---

### GA4 – Matchups & Counters

#### GA4 is Favored Against

- **Creature swarm / token decks**
  - Prison + Tabernacle effects + Moat-style effects are brutal.
- **Battlecruiser goodstuff midrange**
  - Decks that want to tap out each turn for one big spell.
- **Spell-slinger / storm**
  - Rule of Law, Deafening Silence, Narset, and Flusterstorm crush multiple-spell turns.
- **Slow, tap-out “draw-go” control**
  - You tax their removal and countermagic while building unanswerable lock pieces.

#### GA4 Struggles Against / Gets Countered By

- **Fast turbo-combo** (cEDH-style)
  - Decks that win by turn 3–4 can get under your locks.
- **Low-curve, redundant interaction decks**
  - “Goodstuff control” with cheap removal and counters can keep you off key pieces.
- **Green-based enchantment/artifact hate**
  - Cards like Force of Vigor, Krosan Grip, Aura Shards, Heliod’s Intervention are brutal.
  - CA-Ext/Mid, Naya Enchantress, “fair” Selesnya decks with lots of Disenchant effects.
- **Red “big spell” and cascade decks with inevitability**
  - Jund / Temur decks that destroy your mana rocks and lands, then drop haymakers.
- **Aggressive “punch prison in the face” decks**
  - Voltron decks (like Rafiq, Sigarda), and Gruul/Boros midrange that simply attack GA4 early, forcing them to spend resources defending instead of locking the table.

---

## Archetype 2: CA – Bant Hatebears / Blink

**Commander:** Roon of the Hidden Realm  
**Colors:** Green–White–Blue  
**Name origin:** “CA” originally came from a “**C**ontrol–**A**ggro” idea: a deck that controls with hate creatures but wins via combat. In practice, it’s **Bant Hatebears + Blink**, centered on Roon.

### What CA Does

- Disrupts opponents with **hatebears** (small disruptive creatures):
  - Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, Gaddock Teeg, Drannith Magistrate, Collector Ouphe.
- Uses **ETB creatures** as removal & value:
  - Skyclave Apparition, Deputy of Detention, Knight of Autumn, Acidic Slime.
- **Blinks** those ETB creatures with:
  - Roon, Restoration Angel, Venser, the Sojourner, Soulherder-style effects (if included).
- Plays a **fair but annoying game**:
  - You can play spells, but:
    - Your spells cost more.
    - Your artifacts don’t work.
    - Your commander is locked out or turned into an Elk / bug.

**Design considerations:**

- Creature density is high; Roon wants targets to blink.
- Enchantment package (Aura Shards, Rule of Law in Ext, various auras) is used to:
  - Enhance pillowfort / hate.
  - Turn removal into **enchantments** that can be recurred via Sun Titan / Hall.
- Ext versions:
  - Add Gilded Drake, multiple Rule of Law effects, Armageddon, and deep stax pieces.
- Low versions:
  - Fewer hard locks, more value creatures (Mulldrifter, Solemn Simulacrum), less mean hate.

### What CA is Known For

- Being **interactive and fair-feeling** while still powerful.
- Feeling like a “toolbox” deck:
  - See a problem? Tutor or blink into the specific hatebear / ETB creature that answers it.
- Having a **wide tuning range**:
  - Can be a friendly mid-power Roon deck or a nasty Bant stax engine.

---

### CA – Matchups & Counters

#### CA is Favored Against

- **Linear, synergy-based decks**
  - Artifact decks, graveyard decks, tribal creature decks – because you can tailor hatebears to them.
- **Prison / stax that rely on artifacts / enchantments**
  - Aura Shards, Force of Vigor, Knight of Autumn, etc., let you systematically dismantle prisons like GA4.
- **Voltron**
  - CA can repeatedly exile or lock the commander (Darksteel Mutation, Song of the Dryads, etc.).

#### CA Struggles Against / Gets Countered By

- **Hard control with lots of sweepers**
  - Decks that run repeated wraths and value engines (e.g., Esper control, Grixis control) can grind you out if you overextend.
- **Spell-based combo with fewer creatures**
  - “Spell combo” (e.g., Underworld Breach storm, Kess storm) that mostly ignores creature-based hatebears.
- **Big mana / ramp that goes over the top**
  - Extremely tuned RGX / other Simic decks that ramp so hard that your incremental hate can’t keep up without strong stax pieces.
- **Fast combo**
  - As with GA4, true cEDH turbo-combo can go under your setup unless CA-Ext is built with enough cheap interaction.

---

## Archetype 3: SU – Sultai Graveyard Value–Combo

**Commander:** Muldrotha, the Gravetide  
**Colors:** Black–Green–Blue  
**Name origin:** “SU” stands for **S**ultai **U**tility – a Sultai-colored shell that uses the graveyard as a toolbox and value engine.

### What SU Does

- **Fills the graveyard**:
  - Satyr Wayfinder, Stitcher’s Supplier, Mesmeric Orb, self-mill spells.
- **Replays permanents from the graveyard**:
  - Muldrotha lets you cast one permanent of each type from your graveyard every turn.
- Uses **value loops and compact combos**:
  - Protean Hulk, Mikaeus + Triskelion/Walking Ballista, Underworld Breach + Lion’s Eye Diamond + Brain Freeze, etc. (in Ext versions).
- Plays a **midrange-y “inevitable” game**:
  - Your pieces come back over and over; killing once is rarely enough.

**Design considerations:**

- You’re naturally resilient to removal but **weak to graveyard hate**.
- Ext versions:
  - Fully embrace Hulk/Breach/Oracle lines, lots of tutors, and stack interaction.
- Mid:
  - More “value first, combo second.” Fewer tutors, more redundant value pieces.
- Low:
  - Almost a “Sultai goodstuff” deck with a graveyard slant; combo is possible but not the main show.

### What SU is Known For

- Feeling like the **“final boss” midrange deck** – if the game goes long, SU tends to be favored.
- Presenting a constant tension:
  - “Do we exile their graveyard *now*, or can we afford to wait one more turn?”

---

### SU – Matchups & Counters

#### SU is Favored Against

- **Fair midrange / goodstuff** decks
  - You grind longer and recur better than they do.
- **Single-target removal piles**
  - Removal is less effective; the graveyard is your hand #2.
- **Creature-based boards without graveyard hate**
  - Your value and recursion out-scale them.

#### SU Struggles Against / Gets Countered By

- **Dedicated graveyard hate**
  - Relic of Progenitus, Rest in Peace, Dauthi Voidwalker, Leyline of the Void, Bojuka Bog used properly.
- **Fast combo that doesn’t interact with the yard**
  - Thoracle/Consult decks in cEDH style, Dockside-based combo, storm.
- **Prison that attacks your mana** (GA4 or similar)
  - If they stop you from casting spells, you can’t leverage the graveyard engine.
- **Decks with high instant-speed interaction + clock**
  - Grixis tempo / midrange, some Izzet builds: they pressure your life total while tagging key engines.

---

## Archetype 4: RGX – Simic Lands / Big Mana

**Commander:** Aesi, Tyrant of Gyre Strait  
**Colors:** Green–Blue  
**Name origin:** “RGX” stands for **R**amp–**G**rowth–**X**-spells – a Simic shell that ramps lands and funnels that mana into huge X spells or massive boards.

### What RGX Does

- **Ramps lands hard**:
  - Cultivate, Kodama’s Reach, Nature’s Lore, Sakura-Tribe Elder, Azusa, Oracle of Mul Daya, Exploration/Burgeoning.
- **Plays extra lands and draws cards**:
  - Aesi gives landfall card draw and extra land drops.
- **Leverages land-based engines**:
  - Life from the Loam, Crucible of Worlds, Field of the Dead, World Shaper, Scapeshift, Splendid Reclamation.
- **Wins with massive board states**:
  - Avenger of Zendikar, Rampaging Baloths, Craterhoof Behemoth, giant X-spells, or extra-turn chains in extreme versions.

**Design considerations:**

- Heavily **land-focused**: fewer artifacts, more basics/dual synergies, Candelabra of Tawnos in Ext.
- Ext:
  - Enters “big mana cEDH-adjacent” territory with extra turns and very explosive finishers.
- Mid:
  - Strong but fair – ramp into big haymakers, some interaction, some recursion.
- Low:
  - More battlecruiser-y. Big creatures, simpler combos, and less oppressive extra-turns stuff.

### What RGX is Known For

- Being **fun and splashy** for casual players – big plays, lots of cards and tokens.
- Giving the pilot a sense of “I always have something to do,” at the cost of being a target once it snowballs.

---

### RGX – Matchups & Counters

#### RGX is Favored Against

- **Low-interaction creature decks**
  - You go bigger and faster; your card draw lets you keep threats coming.
- **Slow control that can’t punish early ramp**
  - If opponents let you get to 10+ mana uncontested, you dictate the game.
- **Prison decks without enough land hate**
  - If they only tax spells and not lands, you can still slip through and cast huge spells.

#### RGX Struggles Against / Gets Countered By

- **Stax / prison that attacks lands and untap steps**
  - Winter Orb, Back to Basics, Hokori, Armageddon, land destruction.
- **Hyper-fast combo**
  - If they win before your ramp matters, you’re just durdling.
- **Cheap countermagic + tempo**
  - Izzet / Grixis tempo that counters your early ramp spells and lands threats while attacking you.
- **Strong “Aristocrats” or sacrifice decks**
  - If they can convert every creature into damage / value, your big creatures can feel clunky.

---

## Cross-Archetype Matchup Summary

Here’s a **very rough** summary of how these four archetypes line up against each other in a typical 4-player game:

- **GA4 vs CA**
  - **CA** has the tools to dismantle artifacts/enchantments and hates mana rocks.
  - GA4 can still win by locking CA’s mana and commander, but CA is one of GA4’s **best natural predators**.

- **GA4 vs SU**
  - GA4 can shut off SU’s mana and slow the game down.
  - SU can fight back with counterspells and enchantment/artifact hate, but **well-piloted GA4-Ext is favored** if the table doesn’t dogpile GA4 early.

- **GA4 vs RGX**
  - GA4’s untap/land-based stax (Winter Orb, Back to Basics, Hokori) is brutal for RGX.
  - RGX needs early **Force of Vigor / Krosan Grip / counterspells** to stay afloat.
  - GA4 is generally favored if it sees its lock pieces.

- **CA vs SU**
  - CA’s graveyard hate (Scavenging Ooze, Rest in Peace, Relic, etc.) and hatebears can keep SU honest.
  - SU can eventually overpower CA if graveyard hate is light or not drawn.
  - This is close; depends heavily on **who assembles their engine first**.

- **CA vs RGX**
  - CA can slow RGX via Thalia/Ouphe/land hate.
  - RGX, if not checked early, can go much bigger in the mid/late game.
  - Slight lean **CA** at high power (lots of hate), but **RGX** can still run away in mid/low-power pods.

- **SU vs RGX**
  - Both like longer games.  
  - SU has better inevitability via recurrent combo engines; RGX wins if it snowballs land advantage and kills table quickly.
  - Slight lean **SU** in grindy pods, **RGX** in more casual battlecruiser settings.

---

## Other Archetypes Mentioned / Implied Counters

While we didn’t build full lists for these, they’re important in the **rock–paper–scissors** environment:

- **Goodstuff Midrange (any color combo)**  
  - Preys on **low-synergy decks** and weaker combo decks.
  - Gets punished by **hard prison** and **hyper-tuned combo**.

- **Voltron (e.g., Rafiq, Sigarda, Uril)**  
  - Good at **racing prison** players who tap out to deploy locks.
  - Weak to **targeted exile and aura-based commander lockdown** (Darksteel Mutation, Song of the Dryads).

- **Wheels / Draw-7 decks (Nekusar, Niv-Mizzet)**  
  - Great at punishing greedy hands and combo players.
  - Weak to **Rule of Law** and **Narset / Notion Thief locks**.

- **Aristocrats / Sacrifice (Teysa, Korvold)**  
  - Good against **single-target removal** and big creature decks.
  - Weak to **Rest in Peace**, **Cursed Totem** (in some versions), and mass exile.

- **cEDH-style Turbo Combo (Thassa’s Oracle/Consult, Dockside loops, etc.)**  
  - Generally outraces all four archetypes if not checked, but can be fought with:
    - GA4’s stax,
    - CA’s hatebears + interaction,
    - SU’s own compact combo packages,
    - RGX’s countermagic if tuned.

---

## TODO: Future Builds to Add

Some future directions that would round out this “Commander lab”:

1. **Red-Based Wheels / “CB” (Counter–Burn) Archetype**
   - Grixis or Jeskai wheels deck that punishes prison and goodstuff with repeated hand resets.
   - Natural predator to GA4 if built with the right interaction.

2. **Low-Salt GA4-like Control without Hard Stax**
   - UW control that focuses on counters, card draw, and fair sweepers rather than lock pieces.
   - Good “gateway” deck for people who like GA4’s colors but hate being the villain.

3. **Mardu Aristocrats / Sacrifice**
   - Strong midrange / combo deck that pressures life totals and graveyards.
   - Natural predator to big mana and battlecruiser decks.

4. **Naya Tokens / Go-Wide**
   - Provides a clearly different angle for casual tables and serves as prey for prison, while preying on single-target removal decks.

5. **5-Color Political / Group Hug**
   - Low-salt archetype for larger tables that want chaos and politics.
   - Can be used to offset the “feel-bad” factor of prison and combo at the table.

6. **Dedicated Anti-Graveyard Control**
   - e.g., Orzhov or Azorius control built specifically to hate graveyards (Rest in Peace, Dauthi, Kaya) to keep SU-like decks honest.

7. **Mono-Red or Boros Land Destruction / “Meta Nuclear Option”**
   - Only for groups that explicitly consent.  
   - Would help test how far tables are willing to go in arms races against GA4/SU.

If you’re using the **master spreadsheet**:

- Filter by **Deck name** (e.g., `GA4-Ext`, `CA-Mid`) to see which cards belong to that 100-card list.
- Use **salt tier filters** to pick appropriate power levels for your group.
- Use this README as a “meta map” for:
  - Choosing which deck to bring,
  - Predicting what you’ll be strong/weak against,
  - And deciding **who should be the villain** in tonight’s game.
