# Muldrotha Lifegain Analysis

**Research Date**: 2026-01-03
**Research Focus**: What lifegain cards do Muldrotha players actually use?

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding**: Lifegain is **NOT a primary strategy** in Muldrotha decks. Only 13 decks on EDHREC are tagged with "Lifegain" compared to 2,200+ Sacrifice decks and 1,500+ Mill decks.

However, Muldrotha players DO include **incidental lifegain** through:
1. **Lands-matter cards** (Tatyova, Courser, Zuran Orb)
2. **ETB drain effects** (Gray Merchant of Asphodel, Kokusho)
3. **Graveyard utility** (Scavenging Ooze, Deathrite Shaman)
4. **Landfall triggers** (Retreat to Hagra, Ob Nixilis, Dread Presence)

The lifegain is a **byproduct** of the core graveyard recursion strategy, not the goal.

## Category 1: Lands-Matter Lifegain (Most Popular)

### Tatyova, Benthic Druid ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Why It's Used**:
- Draw + 1 life whenever a land enters the battlefield
- Core lands-matter engine in Muldrotha builds
- Described as "amazing lands engine that lets you play lands, draw cards, gain life"
- Excellent with fetchland recursion from graveyard

**Synergy with Muldrotha**:
- Muldrotha plays lands from graveyard → Tatyova triggers
- Fetchlands from graveyard = double trigger (land enters, crack for another land)
- Can gain 6-8 life per turn cycle with 3-4 land drops

---

### Courser of Kruphix ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Why It's Used**:
- "Staple of green deck builds" providing "life gain plus getting through your deck/lands faster"
- Gains 1 life whenever a land enters
- Play lands from top of library
- Being both creature AND enchantment helps Muldrotha (can replay as either permanent type)

**Synergy with Muldrotha**:
- Dual type (creature + enchantment) = more flexible recursion
- Incidental lifegain while ramping
- Preferred over Oracle of Mul Daya in some builds due to dual typing

**Quote**: "It halts early aggression, frees you from drawing unwanted lands by letting you play them off the top of your deck, and provides incidental life gain"

---

### Zuran Orb ⭐⭐⭐
**Why It's Used**:
- Artifact: Sacrifice a land → gain 2 life
- Zero mana activation
- Synergizes with land recursion

**Synergy with Muldrotha**:
- Crucible of Worlds/Ramunap Excavator + Zuran Orb = repeatable lifegain
- The Gitrog Monster + Zuran Orb + fetchlands = "gain two life, draw a card, and make a 5/3 for free"
- Titania, Protector of Argoth combos

**Combo Example**:
With Gitrog, Tatyova, Zuran Orb, and fetchlands:
1. Play fetchland from graveyard (Tatyova draw + life)
2. Sacrifice to Zuran Orb (+2 life, Gitrog draws)
3. Crack fetchland for basic (Tatyova draw + life, Titania 5/3 token)
4. Repeat next turn

## Category 2: ETB Drain Effects (High Impact)

**Combo**: Kokusho + Gray Merchant loop

- Gray Merchant from graveyard drains all opponents

### Kokusho, the Evening Star ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Why It's Used**:

4. Replay Kokusho as creature (Muldrotha)
5. Next turn: replay Animate Dead

## Category 3: Graveyard Utility with Lifegain

### Scavenging Ooze ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Why It's Used**:
- Graveyard hate + lifegain + grows
- 1G: Exile target card from graveyard, +1/+1 counter, gain 1 life
- Can activate multiple times per turn

**Synergy with Muldrotha**:
- "Graveyard hate, lifegain to offset effects like Necropotence, and potentially a beatstick"
- Exiles opponent graveyard recursion threats while gaining life
- "Every time you kill an opponent's creature, lets you gain a life and make it bigger for one mana, which is insane value"

**Use Case**:
- Answer to opponent graveyard strategies
- Incidental lifegain while controlling opponent graveyards
- Can be replayed from your own graveyard with Muldrotha if removed

- Ramp early, utility late
- Can target your own graveyard if needed for lifegain
- Flexible tool in toolbox strategies

### Retreat to Hagra ⭐⭐⭐
**Why It's Used**:
- Landfall: Each opponent loses 1 life OR target creature gets -1/-0
- Enchantment (replayable with Muldrotha)
- Scales with land drops

**Synergy with Muldrotha**:
- 3-4 land drops per turn = 3-4 life drain per turn

## Category 5: Combo Lifegain (Rare in Muldrotha)

- Whenever opponent loses life, you gain that much life
- Combo piece with Vito, Sanguine Bond

**Synergy with Muldrotha**:
- Enchantment (replayable from graveyard)
- Goes infinite with Vito or Sanguine Bond
- Less common in Muldrotha due to focus on graveyard value over combos

**Combo**: Exquisite Blood + Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose
- Any life loss by opponent triggers both
- Infinite loop kills table

**Note**: Not frequently seen in Muldrotha decks (which prefer grind strategies)

### Aetherflux Reservoir ⭐⭐

## Cards That DON'T Work (Color Identity Issues)

### Soul Warden / Soul's Attendant / Auriok Champion ❌
**Why They're NOT Used**:
- All WHITE creatures (outside Sultai colors)
- Would require 4-color deck
- No search results found for Muldrotha + Soul Sisters

**Verdict**: Color identity conflict makes these unplayable in Muldrotha

## Recommended Lifegain Package for Muldrotha

Based on community deck lists and EDHREC data, here's the optimal lifegain package:

### Core Lands-Matter Lifegain (6 cards)
1. **Tatyova, Benthic Druid** - Primary lands engine + incidental lifegain
2. **Courser of Kruphix** - Dual type, lifegain, card advantage
3. **Zuran Orb** - Repeatable lifegain with land recursion
4. **The Gitrog Monster** - Pairs with Zuran Orb and Tatyova
5. **Radiant Fountain** - Utility land for lifegain
6. **Retreat to Hagra** - Landfall drain enchantment

### High-Impact ETB Lifegain (2 cards)
7. **Gray Merchant of Asphodel** - Best drain/lifegain creature
8. **Kokusho, the Evening Star** - Sacrifice loop lifegain

### Utility Lifegain (2 cards)
9. **Scavenging Ooze** - Graveyard hate + lifegain
10. **Deathrite Shaman** - Mana dork + graveyard utility + lifegain

**Total**: 10 cards providing incidental lifegain while supporting core Muldrotha strategy

**NOT Recommended**: Aetherflux Reservoir, Exquisite Blood (combo-focused, not graveyard synergy)

---

## Why Lifegain is Incidental in Muldrotha

1. **Primary Strategy is Graveyard Value**: Muldrotha wins through recursion loops, not lifegain
2. **Lifegain is Defensive**: Used to stabilize against aggro, not a win condition
3. **Better Synergies Available**: Cards like Tatyova provide lifegain + card draw + landfall
4. **Permanent-Based**: Muldrotha wants permanents, not spells (so no Swords to Plowshares-style lifegain)

---

## Comparison: Muldrotha vs. Glarb Lifegain

| Aspect | Muldrotha | Glarb |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Primary Lifegain** | Gray Merchant, Kokusho | Tatyova, Courser |
| **Lifegain Strategy** | ETB drain effects | Landfall triggers |
| **Frequency** | Incidental (not core) | More central (lands matter) |
| **Best Synergy** | Sacrifice loops | Multiple land drops |
| **Life Loss Mechanics** | None | Eye of Duskmantle (-2 life per cast) |

**Key Difference**: Glarb NEEDS lifegain to offset Eye of Duskmantle's life payment. Muldrotha uses lifegain defensively, not as part of the engine.

**Total Word Count**: ~2,400 words

**Research Conclusion**: Muldrotha decks use lifegain as an **incidental benefit** from lands-matter cards (Tatyova, Courser, Zuran Orb) and ETB drain effects (Gray Merchant, Kokusho). Lifegain is NOT a primary strategy - only 13 lifegain-tagged decks exist compared to 2,200+ sacrifice decks. The best lifegain package supports the core graveyard recursion strategy while providing defensive lifegain as a byproduct.
