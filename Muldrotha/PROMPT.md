## Background

Provide an in-depth, candid, critical review of this Muldrotha deck. It's for competitive casual Commander (not cEDH/tournaments).  what does it do well? what could be improved? The goal of the deck is to have:

- 70% of the play style /wincons be through midrange/value/goodstuff
- 20% through altars
- 10% using a Thoracle combo as an "escape hatch".

You'll be playing in multiplayer and want to deck to be fun. Also, you want it to lean into Muldrotha so it's built around the commander.  It's not meant to be a quick win deck (mostly). It should hold its own against a variety of decks yet doesn't have to be  perfect — it's not for cEDH. Please provide constructive feedback on it.
