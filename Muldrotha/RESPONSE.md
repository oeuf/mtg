# Muldrotha Midrange Value Deck: Comprehensive Review

## Executive Summary

Your current Muldrotha list is a well-constructed competitive casual deck that demonstrates strong understanding of the archetype's core strengths. The 70/20/10 split you've outlined (midrange value / altar loops / Thoracle escape hatch) is achievable, though your current configuration leans slightly heavier toward combo than your stated goals. The proposed changes are mostly sound, with a few adjustments I'd recommend. Overall, this deck should perform well at Bracket 4 tables while maintaining fun, interactive gameplay.

**Current Power Assessment**: 7.5-8/10 | **Target Bracket**: 4 (Optimized)

---

## Part 1: What the Deck Does Well

### Exceptional Mana Base

Your land package is outstanding for competitive casual play. The full fetch land suite (Polluted Delta, Verdant Catacombs, Misty Rainforest, Marsh Flats, Flooded Strand, Windswept Heath) paired with shock lands provides excellent fixing while feeding your graveyard. The inclusion of utility lands like Strip Mine, Phyrexian Tower, Command Beacon, Boseiju Who Endures, and Takenuma creates recurring interaction through Muldrotha that most decks cannot match. The Urborg/Yavimaya package smooths your mana beautifully.

### Strong Muldrotha Synergy Engine

The deck correctly identifies that Muldrotha's power comes from permanent-based value. Your self-mill package with Stitcher's Supplier, Satyr Wayfinder, and Sidisi Brood Tyrant efficiently fills the graveyard. The recursion targets are well-chosen: Spore Frog provides repeatable fog effects that can lock out combat-focused decks, Eternal Witness creates a value loop with any instant or sorcery, and Glen Elendra Archmage offers persistent counterspell protection once Muldrotha is online.

### Excellent Interaction Suite

Your counterspell package is appropriate for the power level. Fierce Guardianship, Force of Negation, Pact of Negation, Mana Drain, Counterspell, and Swan Song provide layered protection without being oppressive. The removal suite with Assassin's Trophy, Pernicious Deed, Toxic Deluge, and Cyclonic Rift handles most board states effectively.

### Well-Integrated Combo Lines

The Thoracle/Consultation package is compact and doesn't require extensive deck-building concessions. Your altar package (Ashnod's, Phyrexian, and Altar of Dementia) creates multiple potential loops with Gravecrawler, Bloodghast, and Pitiless Plunderer. Syr Konrad serves as both a value piece and a combo payoff, which is exactly the kind of dual-purpose card this archetype wants.

### Card Advantage Density

Rhystic Study, Mystic Remora, Sylvan Library, and The One Ring provide substantial card advantage. The inclusion of Fact or Fiction and Windfall adds burst draw that also fills your graveyard, serving double duty in this shell.

---

## Part 2: Areas for Improvement

### Missing Sol Ring

This is the most glaring omission. Sol Ring is functionally a free inclusion in every Commander deck, and Muldrotha is no exception. Even without artifact recursion themes, the card is simply too efficient to exclude. At Bracket 4, every opponent will have one, and starting a turn behind on mana acceleration puts unnecessary pressure on your early game.

### Hermit Druid Problem

Hermit Druid is a complicated inclusion that works against your stated 70/20/10 goals. With only 11 basics in your current list (4 Forest, 3 Island, 4 Swamp), Hermit Druid threatens to mill your entire library in one activation. This creates an uncomfortable tension: either you're holding Hermit Druid as a combo piece (which skews your percentages toward combo), or you're using it inefficiently as a self-mill piece when better alternatives exist. For a deck aiming at 70% midrange, Hermit Druid sends the wrong signal to opponents and can lead to "kill on sight" threat assessment that damages your ability to play the value game.

### Insufficient Creature-Based Ramp

Your ramp package relies heavily on non-creature sources: Arcane Signet, Mana Vault, Exploration, Bloom Tender, and Deathrite Shaman. While Bloom Tender and Deathrite Shaman are excellent, the deck would benefit from additional creature-based ramp that can be recurred through Muldrotha. Sakura-Tribe Elder is conspicuously absent, despite being one of the highest-synergy cards in the archetype according to EDHREC data (50% inclusion in optimized lists, 26% synergy).

### Limited Artifact/Enchantment Removal

Beyond Boseiju Who Endures and Pernicious Deed, your main-deck answers to problematic artifacts and enchantments are limited. Cards like Rhystic Study, Smothering Tithe, and various stax pieces are common at Bracket 4 tables, and having recurrable answers through Muldrotha significantly increases your flexibility. Seal of Primordium (46% inclusion, 41% synergy), Haywire Mite (48% inclusion, 43% synergy), and Caustic Caterpillar are high-synergy inclusions that many optimized lists run.

### Graveyard Hate Gap

Your deck is highly vulnerable to opposing graveyard strategies while lacking proactive graveyard hate of your own. Opposition Agent and Dauthi Voidwalker provide some incidental hate, but a dedicated piece like Bojuka Bog (35% inclusion in optimized lists), Soul-Guide Lantern, or Nihil Spellbomb would give you a recurrable answer to opposing graveyard decks without significantly diluting your strategy.

### Six Is Underperforming

Six is a solid card in land-focused strategies, but in your current configuration, it competes with Ramunap Excavator for the "play lands from graveyard" slot while not providing the same level of synergy. Your deck isn't built around landfall triggers or land-matters themes beyond Life from the Loam, making Six a relatively low-impact inclusion. The 27% inclusion rate in optimized Muldrotha lists is lower than cards like Sakura-Tribe Elder, Mulldrifter, or River Kelpie for good reason.

### Tatyova Without Sufficient Support

Tatyova, Benthic Druid is powerful when you're reliably playing multiple lands per turn. With only Exploration, Dryad of the Ilysian Grove, and Gitrog Monster enabling extra land plays, Tatyova often becomes a 5-mana creature that draws you one card per turn cycle. This is fine but not exceptional at Bracket 4. Given that Gitrog Monster already provides land-based card advantage, cutting Tatyova is reasonable.

## Part 3: Analysis of Your Proposed Changes

### Additions Analysis

| Card | Verdict | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Force of Will** | Strong Include | Adds another free counterspell for protecting your commander or disrupting opponent combos. Worth the card disadvantage in a deck with strong card draw. |
| **Sol Ring** | Essential Include | Should already be in the deck. No explanation needed. |
| **Sakura-Tribe Elder** | Strong Include | One of the highest-synergy cards for Muldrotha. Provides ramp, triggers death effects, and is recurrable. |
| **Nature's Lore / Three Visits** | Moderate Include | Efficient ramp that finds your shock lands. Competes with Cultivate, but faster. |
| **Swiftfoot Boots** | Moderate Include | Protecting Muldrotha is important, but Lightning Greaves already exists. Hexproof is better than shroud for targeting your own creatures. |
| **Siren Stormtamer** | Strong Include | 32% inclusion in optimized lists with 27% synergy. Repeatable protection through Muldrotha that also provides a 1-drop creature for altar loops. |
| **Seal of Primordium** | Strong Include | 46% inclusion, 41% synergy. Recurrable artifact/enchantment removal is exactly what Muldrotha wants. |
| **Caustic Caterpillar** | Strong Include | Budget alternative to Haywire Mite with creature typing for altar loops. |
| **River Kelpie** | Strong Include | 20% inclusion with 13% synergy. Draws cards whenever you cast from graveyard or when persist creatures return. Creates excellent value loops. |
| **Mulldrifter** | Strong Include | 29% inclusion, 20% synergy. Evoke for 3, draw two, recur with Muldrotha for repeatable card advantage. |
| **Bojuka Bog / Nihil Spellbomb / Soul-Guide Lantern** | Include One | Bojuka Bog is recurrable with Muldrotha and Life from the Loam. Soul-Guide Lantern cantrips. Either works. |
| **Birthing Pod** | Strong Include | 12% inclusion but high synergy. Turns any creature into the next piece you need while filling your graveyard. |
| **Demonic Tutor** | Strong Include | 50% inclusion in optimized lists. Essential tutor that finds any card you need. |
| **Vampiric Tutor** | Strong Include | 32% inclusion. Instant-speed tutor on opponent's end step is powerful. |
| **Haywire Mite** | Strong Include | 48% inclusion, 43% synergy. One of the highest-synergy cards in Muldrotha specifically. |
| **Ashiok, Dream Render** | Strong Include | 38% inclusion, 34% synergy. Shuts down opposing tutors while milling yourself. Excellent hate piece. |

### Proposed Cut Analysis

| Cut | Verdict | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hermit Druid** | Agree to Cut | Works against 70% midrange goal. Replace with Nyx Weaver for controlled self-mill. |
| **Cultivate** | Agree to Cut | 3-mana ramp is slow for Bracket 4. Nature's Lore at 2 mana is more efficient. |
| **Six** | Agree to Cut | Underperforms without dedicated land strategy. Ramunap Excavator already fills this role. |
| **Windfall** | Disagree | Windfall fills your graveyard while disrupting opponent hands. Keep this. |
| **Fact or Fiction** | Disagree | Excellent card selection that puts cards in graveyard. Keep this. |
| **Gravebreaker Lamia** | Lean Agree | With Demonic Tutor and Vampiric Tutor added, this becomes somewhat redundant. The lifelink body is relevant, but 5 mana is expensive. |
| **Tatyova, Benthic Druid** | Agree to Cut | Not enough land-drop support to make this shine. Gitrog Monster already fills this role better. |
| **Necromancy** | Disagree | Flash-speed reanimation is powerful and distinct from Animate Dead/Reanimate. Keep this. |
| **Reassembling Skeleton** | Lean Disagree | This is a key piece for altar loops. If you want 20% altar combo, keep this. |
| **Sidisi, Brood Tyrant** | Lean Disagree | Creates tokens for sacrifice, mills on attack, and is a creature type you can recur. Solid value. |
| **Deathrite Shaman** | Disagree | This card does everything Muldrotha wants: ramp, graveyard hate, and incidental lifegain/damage. Keep it. |
| **The One Ring** | Lean Disagree | Powerful protection and card draw. The burden counters are manageable in multiplayer. |
| **Dryad of the Ilysian Grove** | Lean Agree | Without dedicated land strategy, this is just color fixing. You already have excellent fixing. |
| **Mana Vault** | Disagree | Fast mana is valuable for deploying Muldrotha early. Keep this. |

## Part 4: Refined Recommendations

Based on my analysis, here is my recommended configuration that maintains your 70/20/10 goals.

### Cards to Add (16)

1. Sol Ring (essential)
2. Force of Will (protection)
3. Sakura-Tribe Elder (ramp + synergy)
4. Nature's Lore (efficient ramp)
5. Siren Stormtamer (protection)
6. Seal of Primordium (removal)
7. Haywire Mite (removal)
8. Mulldrifter (card advantage)
9. River Kelpie (card advantage + combo support)
10. Bojuka Bog (graveyard hate)
11. Birthing Pod (tutor engine)
12. Demonic Tutor (essential tutor)
13. Vampiric Tutor (essential tutor)
14. Ashiok, Dream Render (hate + self-mill)
15. Nyx Weaver (controlled self-mill)
16. Lotus Petal (fast mana, high synergy with Muldrotha)

### Cards to Cut (16)

1. Hermit Druid (too combo-focused)
2. Cultivate (too slow)
3. Six (insufficient support)
4. Gravebreaker Lamia (redundant with tutors)
5. Tatyova, Benthic Druid (insufficient support)
6. Dryad of the Ilysian Grove (unnecessary fixing)
7. One additional basic land (to add Bojuka Bog)
8. Consider: Swiftfoot Boots could replace one of the protection pieces if you prefer redundancy over Siren Stormtamer

### Cards to Keep (from your proposed cuts)

- Windfall (graveyard filler + disruption)
- Fact or Fiction (card selection)
- Necromancy (flash reanimation)
- Reassembling Skeleton (altar combo piece for your 20%)
- Sidisi, Brood Tyrant (value engine)
- Deathrite Shaman (multitool)
- The One Ring (protection + draw)
- Mana Vault (fast mana)

---

## Part 5: Win Condition Breakdown

With the recommended changes, your win conditions align with your 70/20/10 goal.

### Primary Path: Midrange Value (70%)

Your primary game plan involves establishing Muldrotha and grinding incremental advantage through permanent recursion. Recurring Spore Frog locks out combat. Eternal Witness loops provide card advantage. Glen Elendra Archmage protects your position. Eventually, you win through accumulated board presence, Syr Konrad pings from natural gameplay, or simply attacking with creatures when opponents are exhausted.

### Secondary Path: Altar Loops (20%)

The altar package creates deterministic wins when assembled. Gravecrawler plus Phyrexian Altar plus any Zombie (or Pitiless Plunderer) generates infinite death triggers. Syr Konrad or Blood Artist effects (if you add one) convert these triggers to damage. Alternatively, Altar of Dementia mills opponents out. These pieces are individually useful for value even without assembling the full combo.

### Emergency Path: Thoracle Consultation (10%)

Demonic Consultation plus Thassa's Oracle remains as a compact, two-card "I win" button for situations where grinding becomes impossible. This combo requires minimal deck-building concessions and serves as an escape hatch against stax or other decks that out-grind you.

---

## Part 6: Notable Cards Absent from Discussion

Based on EDHREC's optimized Muldrotha data, several cards warrant consideration.

**Oko, Thief of Crowns** (26% inclusion, 22% synergy) is a powerful planeswalker that can be cast from the graveyard. His Elk ability handles problematic creatures and artifacts repeatedly through Muldrotha. If you have access to this card, it's worth testing.

**Displacer Kitten** (35% inclusion, 32% synergy) creates additional value by blinking permanents whenever you cast a noncreature spell. With Muldrotha's ability to cast permanents from your graveyard, this generates substantial value loops.

**Secrets of the Dead** (32% inclusion, 29% synergy) provides card draw whenever you cast from your graveyard. This is pure gas in Muldrotha and works with every permanent type.

**Mesmeric Orb** (30% inclusion, 18% synergy) is controversial but extremely efficient self-mill. Each permanent untapping mills you one card, which fills your graveyard rapidly. The downside is it affects opponents too.

**Lotus Petal** (58% inclusion, 49% synergy) deserves special mention. This is one of the highest-synergy cards in Muldrotha specifically because you can replay it every turn for free mana acceleration. If you're not running it, you should be.

---

## Part 7: Matchup Considerations

### Favorable Matchups

Your deck performs well against creature-based aggro (Spore Frog recursion), midrange value decks (you out-grind most opponents), and combat-focused strategies (Cyclonic Rift and Pernicious Deed reset the board).

### Challenging Matchups

Fast combo decks that win before turn 5-6 can race you before Muldrotha comes online. Graveyard hate shuts down your primary engine. Stax decks that prevent you from casting spells or using activated abilities can be problematic. The Thoracle escape hatch helps here.

### Adaptation Strategies

Against graveyard hate, prioritize your counterspells for Rest in Peace, Leyline of the Void, and similar effects. Against stax, look for windows to resolve Muldrotha or pivot to the Thoracle line. Against fast combo, mulligan for early interaction and try to slow them until you can establish your value engine.

---

## Final Assessment

Your Muldrotha deck is well-positioned for competitive casual play at Bracket 4. The core engine is sound, the interaction suite is appropriate, and the win conditions are achievable. The recommended changes address gaps in creature ramp, artifact/enchantment removal, and graveyard hate while removing cards that either underperform or push the deck too far toward combo.

The deck successfully leans into Muldrotha as the centerpiece while maintaining backup plans when your commander is unavailable. Post-changes, you should find the gameplay experience aligns with your 70/20/10 goal: primarily grinding value, occasionally assembling altar loops, and rarely needing the Thoracle escape hatch.

**Final Power Assessment**: 7.5-8/10 | **Salt Score**: 4-5/10 (Consultation/Oracle may raise eyebrows at some tables)
