# Muldrotha Midrange Value Deck: Professional Critique & Assessment

**Reviewer**: The MTG Strategist
**Date**: 2025-12-31
**Deck Archetype**: Sultai Midrange Value with Combo Backup
**Target Power Level**: Bracket 4 (Competitive Casual)
**Strategic Goal**: 70% Midrange / 20% Altars / 10% Thoracle

---

## Executive Summary

Your Muldrotha deck represents a **well-executed vision of competitive casual Commander** with strong technical fundamentals and coherent strategic identity. The post-optimization list successfully achieves your stated 70/20/10 balance while maintaining high power density and meaningful Muldrotha synergy. However, the deck exhibits **strategic ambiguity** in key moments where midrange and combo lines intersect, creating both its greatest strength (flexibility) and its primary weakness (decision complexity).

### Overall Scores

| Category | Score | Justification |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **Power Level** | **8.0/10** | Solid Bracket 4; competitive at optimized casual tables |
| **Consistency** | **8.5/10** | Excellent tutor density, strong card advantage engines |
| **Resilience** | **7.5/10** | Recovers well from interaction but vulnerable to graveyard hate |
| **Interactivity** | **8/10** | Strong interaction suite without being oppressive |
| **Strategy Cohesion** | **9/10** | Exceptional alignment with Muldrotha's abilities |
| **Adaptability** | **8.5/10** | Multiple win paths enable meta flexibility |
| **Fun to Pilot** | **9/10** | High decision density, rewards tight play |
| **Fun to Play Against** | **6.5/10** | Can feel inevitable; "answer or lose" Muldrotha moments |
| **Predictability** | **6/10** | Muldrotha = expected; specific lines less telegraphed |
| **Pilot Difficulty** | **7.5/10** | Medium-high skill floor, high skill ceiling |
| **Salt Score** | **5/10** | Moderate salt; accepted at Bracket 4 but not casual-friendly |

**Recommended for**: Experienced players seeking high-powered casual games with technical depth
**Not recommended for**: Casual battlecruiser pods, new players, anti-combo playgroups

## I. Deck Identity & Strategic Cohesion

### Strategic Thesis: A Critique

Your 70/20/10 framework is **conceptually sound** but creates implementation challenges. Here's why:

**The 70% Midrange Claim**: Your deck functions as midrange when Muldrotha resolves and survives. However, ~13 cards (Secrets of the Dead, River Kelpie, Seal of Primordium, Kaya's Ghostform, etc.) are *specifically engineered* for Muldrotha recursion. Without your commander, these cards underperform dramatically. This isn't inherently problematic—commander-centric design is valid—but it creates **binary gameplay states**:

- **State A (Muldrotha Active)**: Oppressive value engine that out-grinds most midrange decks
- **State B (Muldrotha Suppressed)**: Goodstuff deck with awkward permanents

True midrange decks (Korvold, Chulane value builds) function at 80-90% power without their commander. Your deck operates at ~60-70% without Muldrotha, then jumps to 120% with her online. This creates **polarized gameplay** rather than smooth midrange consistency.

**The 20% Altar Combo**: Well-integrated. Altar pieces (Phyrexian Altar, Ashnod's Altar, Altar of Dementia) + recursive creatures (Gravecrawler, Bloodghast, Reassembling Skeleton) + payoffs (Syr Konrad) function individually as value pieces. This is **textbook good combo design**—pieces aren't dead cards. The loops feel earned, not "two-card I-win" buttons.

**The 10% Thoracle Escape Hatch**: The **Demonic Consultation cut was correct**. Without it, Thoracle becomes an "if naturally milled" win rather than dedicated combo. However, this raises questions: if you only win via Thoracle 10% of the time, and half those wins come from natural mill (not combo), why include it? The card is only justifiable if you can reliably *tutor + execute* the combo when needed—which requires Consultation or Tainted Pact. Your current configuration treats Thoracle as a "maybe win" rather than escape hatch.

**Verdict**: The deck is more accurately **50% Muldrotha-Dependent Value / 30% Goodstuff Midrange / 20% Altars** with Thoracle as a non-functional 10th slot. This isn't criticism—it's clarity.

---

## II. What the Deck Does Exceptionally Well

### 1. **Mana Base Excellence** (9.5/10)

Your land package is **near-perfect** for 3-color fetch-shock configuration:

- **6 fetch lands** (Polluted Delta, Misty Rainforest, Verdant Catacombs, Marsh Flats, Flooded Strand, Windswept Heath) thin deck, enable shuffle effects, fill graveyard
- **3 shock lands** untapped fixing fetchable by Nature's Lore
- **Urborg/Yavimaya package** fixes colors, enables Cabal Coffers lines (if added)
- **Utility land density**: Boseiju Who Endures, Bojuka Bog, Strip Mine, Phyrexian Tower, Takenuma, Command Beacon

**Recurring utility lands via Muldrotha** is a **signature strength** most commanders cannot replicate. Strip Mine becomes "destroy target land every turn." Bojuka Bog becomes repeatable graveyard hate. This is where your deck separates from generic Sultai goodstuff.

**Minor critique**: 33 lands is slightly low for a 6-drop commander. Consider 34-35 to ensure hitting land drops turns 1-6. Missing turn 3-4 land drops severely delays Muldrotha.

---

### 2. **Card Advantage Engine Design** (9/10)

Post-optimization, your card draw package is **exceptional**:

- **Passive engines**: Rhystic Study, Mystic Remora, Sylvan Library (opponents fuel you)
- **Graveyard synergy**: Secrets of the Dead, River Kelpie (trigger on Muldrotha casts)
- **Recurrable value**: Mulldrifter evoke loops, Eternal Witness loops

**Secrets of the Dead** deserves special mention: at 2 mana, it draws a card whenever you cast from graveyard. With Muldrotha casting 3 permanents/turn, this is **Ancestral Recall every turn**. This card alone justifies heavy Muldrotha investment.

**Critical observation**: Your draw engines are **permanent-based**, meaning they're recurrable. This is strategically correct. Sorcery-speed draw (Night's Whisper, Sign in Blood) would be one-shot effects. You've correctly prioritized engines over bursts.

---

### 3. **Interaction Suite Balance** (8.5/10)

Your countermagic density (7 pieces) hits the **sweet spot** for Bracket 4:

**Free/Efficient Counters**: Force of Will, Force of Negation, Fierce Guardianship, Pact of Negation
**Flex Counters**: Mana Drain, Counterspell, Swan Song

This prevents fast combo without being control-deck oppressive. You're **selectively interactive**, protecting Muldrotha and stopping game-ending threats while allowing opponents to execute fair strategies.

**Removal quality** is similarly balanced:
- **Flexible**: Assassin's Trophy, Cyclonic Rift, Toxic Deluge, Pernicious Deed
- **Recurrable**: Seal of Primordium, Haywire Mite, Glen Elendra Archmage

**Why this works**: Removal that returns to graveyard (Seal, Haywire, Glen Elendra) becomes **inevitability**. Opponents can't permanently answer your answers. This is Muldrotha's design space exploited correctly.

---

### 4. **Tutor Density & Quality** (9/10)

8 tutors with excellent role distribution:

- **Universal**: Demonic Tutor, Vampiric Tutor (find anything)
- **Type-Specific**: Mystical Tutor (instants/sorceries), Worldly Tutor (creatures)
- **Graveyard Setup**: Entomb, Buried Alive (reanimator synergy)
- **Creature Toolbox**: Birthing Pod, Survival of the Fittest

This creates **consistency without homogenization**. Each tutor has strategic nuance (instant-speed Vampiric vs sorcery Demonic; Entomb for reanimation vs Worldly for hand).

**Birthing Pod** deserves emphasis: sacrifice 2-drop Sakura-Tribe Elder → fetch 3-drop Eternal Witness → sacrifice Witness → fetch 4-drop Glen Elendra Archmage. You've built **creature chains** where each step generates value.

---

### 5. **Altar Combo Integration** (9/10)

Your altar package is **textbook good combo design**:

**Outlets**: Phyrexian Altar, Ashnod's Altar, Altar of Dementia
**Engines**: Gravecrawler, Bloodghast, Reassembling Skeleton
**Payoffs**: Syr Konrad, Altar of Dementia (mill)

**Why this works**:
- **Individually useful**: Phyrexian Altar ramps, Bloodghast recurs for value, Syr Konrad pings from natural gameplay
- **Multiple paths**: Gravecrawler + Phyrexian + any Zombie = infinite. Bloodghast + Ashnod's + Phyrexian Tower = loops. Not reliant on single line.
- **Doesn't warp deck**: Only ~6-7 cards dedicated; rest is midrange

This is **how combo should be integrated** in 70/20/10 builds. Compare to "oops all combo" decks that dedicate 20+ cards to single line.

---

## III. Critical Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Graveyard Hate Vulnerability** (CRITICAL)

Your primary weakness is **catastrophic failure to graveyard hate**. Rest in Peace, Leyline of the Void, or Grafdigger's Cage **functionally remove Muldrotha's text box**. You have:

- **Proactive hate**: Bojuka Bog (recurrable but slow)
- **Reactive answers**: Counterspells, Boseiju Who Endures

**The problem**: In Bracket 4 pods, graveyard hate is **maindecked** (not sideboarded). Competitive casual players know Muldrotha, Meren, Karador are graveyard-dependent. Expect Rest in Peace game 1.

**Mitigation strategies you lack**:
- **Enchantment removal redundancy**: Only Seal of Primordium + Haywire Mite + Boseiju. If Rest in Peace resolves and Seal is in graveyard (ironic!), you need Boseiju + land sacrifice or draw Haywire.
- **Backup win conditions independent of graveyard**: Your altar loops require recurring creatures from graveyard. Thoracle requires self-mill (graveyard). Only beatdown remains if graveyard exiled.

**Recommendation**: Add **Nature's Claim** or **Assassin's Trophy can already hit enchantments**, but instant-speed 1-mana removal (Nature's Claim, Deglamer) gives you emergency answers. Consider **Endurance** (pitch-cast creature that shuffles graveyards) for instant-speed graveyard protection.

---

### 2. **Commander Dependence Creates Binary Gameplay**

As noted earlier, ~40% of your deck is **optimized for Muldrotha being online**:

- Secrets of the Dead, River Kelpie (draw when casting from graveyard)
- Seal of Primordium, Spore Frog (recurrable permanents)
- Satyr Wayfinder, Stitcher's Supplier, Nyx Weaver (self-mill only good with recursion)

**The strategic problem**: When Muldrotha costs 6 → 8 → 10 → 12 mana due to commander tax, these cards become **actively bad**. Secrets of the Dead draws zero cards. Spore Frog is one-time fog. Satyr Wayfinder mills you closer to decking.

**This creates lose-lose scenarios**:
- **Scenario A**: Don't play Muldrotha early (avoid tax). Your graveyard-synergy cards underperform for 8+ turns.
- **Scenario B**: Play Muldrotha into removal (eat tax). Now can't recast her, and synergy cards are dead.

**Mitigation you have**: Command Beacon (reset tax), Lightning Greaves (protection), counterspells. But this requires **holding up interaction specifically for Muldrotha**, which slows your gameplan.

**Comparison to better-designed commander-centric decks**: Kinnan functions at 70% without commander (ramp payoffs still good). Chulane's creatures are independently useful (Shrieking Drake, Whitemane Lion). Your deck's Muldrotha-specific cards are **parasitic**—only good with commander.

**Recommendation**: Accept this as **strategic trade-off**. You've maximized Muldrotha synergy at cost of commander-tax vulnerability. Alternative would dilute Muldrotha synergy for generic goodstuff (defeating the purpose).

---

### 3. **Thoracle "Escape Hatch" is Non-Functional**

Without Demonic Consultation or Tainted Pact, Thassa's Oracle wins via:

1. **Natural self-mill**: Satyr Wayfinder, Stitcher's Supplier, Nyx Weaver, Sidisi over 10+ turns mill your library naturally. Then cast Oracle.
2. **Altar of Dementia loops**: Sacrifice creatures infinitely, mill yourself, cast Oracle.

**The problem with Route 1**: Milling your entire library naturally takes **15-20 turns** with your current self-mill density. By turn 15-20, you've either:
- Won via altar loops
- Won via combat/Syr Konrad pings
- Lost to opponents

Thoracle becomes **win-more** rather than escape hatch.

**The problem with Route 2**: If you have altar loops assembled, you **win immediately via Syr Konrad** (infinite death triggers = infinite damage). You don't need Oracle. Oracle is redundant.

**Actual escape hatch scenarios**:
- Opponent at 1000 life (Aetherflux Reservoir). Syr Konrad can't kill. Oracle can.
- Platinum Angel/Platinum Emperion in play. Damage doesn't work. Oracle wins via state-based check.

These scenarios occur **<5% of games**. Your "10% escape hatch" is realistically **2% edge-case win**.

**Recommendation**: Either:
- **Option A**: Cut Thassa's Oracle. Add another midrange piece (Ledger Shredder, Displacer Kitten).
- **Option B**: Add Demonic Consultation (as you're now considering). This makes Oracle a **true 2-card combo** usable turn 6-7 as bailout against stax/hate.
- **Option C**: Add Tainted Pact (requires no duplicate nonlands—you're close). Functions identically to Consultation.

**My recommendation**: Option B. 2% of deck (2 cards) for 10% of wins is **efficient**. Your original analysis was correct.

---

### 4. **Fast Combo Vulnerability** (Turn 3-5 Wins)

Your interaction suite is **reactive**, not **proactive**. You have:

- 7 counterspells (protect yourself)
- Limited stax/hatebears (slow opponents)

**Against turn 3-5 combo decks** (Kinnan infinite mana, Godo-Helm, Thrasios-Tymna Thoracle), you're racing. Your gameplan:

1. Deploy Muldrotha turn 4-5
2. Establish value engine turn 5-6
3. Win via altars or value turn 8-10

**The problem**: You're **2-4 turns slower** than cEDH-fringe decks. Your counterspells must successfully stop their combo on **their turn 3-5** while you're developing. If they resolve turn 3 Godo or turn 4 infinite mana, you lose.

**You lack**:
- **Stax pieces**: Rule of Law, Deafening Silence (slow combo)
- **Taxing effects**: Thalia, Sphere of Resistance (make combos expensive)
- **Proactive disruption**: Thoughtseize, Duress (remove combo pieces)

**Recommendation**: This is **acceptable weakness** at Bracket 4. You're not designed to beat cEDH decks. If your meta includes turn 3-5 combo consistently, this is wrong deck choice. If meta is turns 6-10 wins (typical Bracket 4), you're appropriately positioned.

---

### 5. **Limited Artifact/Enchantment Removal Density**

Post-optimization, you have:
- Seal of Primordium, Haywire Mite (recurrable)
- Boseiju Who Endures (land-based)
- Assassin's Trophy (generic removal)
- Pernicious Deed (board wipe)

**This is better than original list**, but still **vulnerable to resolved threats**:

**Problem scenario**: Opponent resolves Rhystic Study turn 3. You have Haywire Mite in hand but no creatures to sacrifice it yet. Opponent draws 8 cards over 2 turn cycles before you draw Muldrotha. Now opponent has 14-card hand, you're behind.

**Fast, unconditional removal** (Nature's Claim, Assassin's Trophy) prevents this. But you can't recur instants via Muldrotha, so you've correctly prioritized permanents.

**Recommendation**: Consider **Caustic Caterpillar** (sideboard). 1-mana creature that sacrifices to destroy artifact/enchantment. Recurrable, altar-compatible. Trade Seal of Primordium for Caustic if you want creature typing over enchantment typing.

## IV. Archetype Matchup Analysis & Adaptability

### vs. **Creature Aggro** (Najeela, Edgar Markov, Ur-Dragon): **FAVORABLE** (65-35)

**Your advantages**:
- **Spore Frog recursion** = repeatable Fog (locks combat)
- **Board wipes**: Toxic Deluge, Pernicious Deed, Cyclonic Rift
- **Blockers**: Baleful Strix, Glen Elendra Archmage (deathtouch/flying)
- **Life total**: 40 life buys time

**Their path to victory**: Overwhelming you before Muldrotha deploys (turn 5-6). If you stabilize with Spore Frog loops, they cannot win via combat.

**Adaptation strategy**: Mulligan for early interaction (Toxic Deluge, Pernicious Deed) + ramp. Prioritize Spore Frog recursion post-Muldrotha.

---

### vs. **Fast Combo** (Kinnan, Godo, Thrasios-Tymna): **UNFAVORABLE** (35-65)

**Your advantages**:
- **7 counterspells** can stop combo
- **Altar loops** race if uninterrupted

**Their advantages**:
- **Speed**: They win turn 3-5, you win turn 7-9
- **Compact combos**: 2-3 cards, hard to disrupt all paths
- **Better tutors**: cEDH decks run 8-12 tutors

**Their path to victory**: Resolve combo before you establish. Force you to hold up interaction every turn (slowing your development).

**Adaptation strategy**: Mulligan for Force of Will, Pact of Negation, Swan Song. Prioritize stopping their first combo attempt. If you survive to turn 6-7, your altar loops can win through their interaction.

---

### vs. **Stax/Prison** (Derevi, GAAIV, Urza): **SLIGHTLY UNFAVORABLE** (45-55)

**Your advantages**:
- **Thoracle bailout** (if Consultation added) bypasses stax
- **Permanent-based removal** (Seal, Boseiju) answers stax pieces
- **Counterspells** prevent stax pieces resolving

**Their advantages**:
- **Tax effects** (Thalia, Sphere of Resistance) make Muldrotha expensive (8-10 mana)
- **Graveyard hate** (Rest in Peace) shuts down strategy
- **Resource denial** (Winter Orb, Stasis) prevents Muldrotha activation (6 mana/turn)

**Their path to victory**: Resolve Rest in Peace or tax effects before you deploy Muldrotha. Lock you out of casting commander. Win via incremental advantage while you're locked.

**Adaptation strategy**: Prioritize countering graveyard hate (Rest in Peace, Leyline) over other stax. Be willing to pay commander tax to remove stax pieces with Boseiju. If locked, pivot to Thoracle combo (requires Consultation).

---

### vs. **Midrange Value** (Chulane, Korvold, Tasigur): **FAVORABLE** (60-40)

**Your advantages**:
- **Muldrotha out-values** most midrange engines (3 permanents/turn > 1-2 cards/turn)
- **Recurring removal** answers their value creatures
- **Altar combo** ends grind faster than they can

**Their advantages**:
- **Less commander-dependent** (function at 70-80% without commander)
- **Better early game** (Chulane draws cards immediately, you need Muldrotha online)

**Your path to victory**: Survive to turn 6-7, deploy Muldrotha, establish Secrets of the Dead or River Kelpie, out-card-advantage them. Win via altars or accumulated board.

**Adaptation strategy**: Trade resources early (removal for their value creatures). Accept going to mid-game. Your late-game value engine (Muldrotha + Secrets) is **superior** to theirs.

---

### vs. **Control** (Rashmi, Baral, Talrand): **SLIGHTLY FAVORABLE** (55-45)

**Your advantages**:
- **Permanent-based threats** (hard for control to counter everything)
- **Recursion** (they answer Muldrotha, you recast)
- **Counterspell density** (7 counters protects your threats)

**Their advantages**:
- **More counterspells** (10-15 in pure control)
- **Card advantage** (Rhystic Study, Mystic Remora, draw spells)

**Your path to victory**: Force them to answer multiple threats. Deploy Rhystic Study early (forces them to pay or give you cards). Resolve Muldrotha when they're tapped out. Grind via recurring permanents.

**Adaptation strategy**: Play into counterspells with bait (ramp spells, value creatures). Save premium threats (Muldrotha, Survival of the Fittest) for when they're tapped out. Don't over-commit to board wipes.

---

### **Adaptability Score: 8.5/10**

Your deck adapts via:
- **Toolbox tutors** (find silver bullets)
- **Flexible interaction** (counters for combo, removal for creatures)
- **Multiple win paths** (altars, value grind, Thoracle)

**Limitation**: **Graveyard hate warps your entire strategy**. Rest in Peace reduces adaptability from 8.5/10 to 4/10 (forced onto backup plan). This is **single point of failure**.

---

## V. Gameplay Experience: Fun Factor, Predictability, Difficulty

### **Fun to Pilot: 9/10** (Excellent)

**Why it's engaging**:

**1. High Decision Density**: Every Muldrotha activation presents **3-way choice** (artifact, creature, enchantment, land). Choosing optimal permanent requires evaluating board state, mana efficiency, sequencing. Example:

- **Option A**: Cast Sakura-Tribe Elder from graveyard, sacrifice for ramp
- **Option B**: Cast Seal of Primordium, hold as removal threat
- **Option C**: Cast Eternal Witness, return counterspell to hand

Each choice has strategic implications. **Skilled pilots win more** by optimizing these micro-decisions.

**2. Toolbox Gameplay**: 8 tutors create **puzzle-solving**. "What card wins from this position?" Demonic Tutor can find:
- Altar piece (combo win)
- Toxic Deluge (board wipe)
- Eternal Witness (recur counterspell)
- Survival of the Fittest (engine)

Optimal tutor targets change based on opponents' board states, life totals, graveyards. This is **intellectually rewarding**.

**3. Sequencing Complexity**: Birthing Pod chains, Survival of the Fittest lines, altar loops require **correct ordering**. Missing 1 step breaks combo. Example altar line:

1. Cast Gravecrawler from graveyard (creature slot)
2. Cast Phyrexian Altar from graveyard (artifact slot)
3. Sacrifice Gravecrawler to Phyrexian for {B}
4. Recast Gravecrawler using {B}
5. Repeat for infinite death triggers
6. Syr Konrad triggers = infinite damage

**If you cast Phyrexian Altar first (artifact slot), you cannot cast Gravecrawler (creature slot occupied)**. Tight play required.

**4. Resource Management**: Balancing graveyard vs hand vs board is **engaging minigame**. Do you mill aggressively (fill graveyard) or conservatively (avoid decking)? Do you cast permanents from hand (save graveyard slots) or graveyard (save hand)?

**Deduction**: Fun ceiling is **extremely high**. This deck rewards mastery.

---

### **Fun to Play Against: 6.5/10** (Moderate-Low)

**Why opponents enjoy**:

**1. Interactive Gameplay**: You're not solitaire combo (storm) or stax-lock (GAAIV hard-lock). Opponents can attack you, remove Muldrotha, pressure life total. Games feel **participatory**.

**2. Telegraphed Threats**: Muldrotha in command zone = opponents know graveyard hate is good. Altar pieces on board = opponents know to remove them. **No surprises** reduces frustration.

**3. Multiple Turn Cycles**: You don't win turn 3-4. Games go 8-12 turns, allowing opponents to execute their strategies.

**Why opponents dislike**:

**1. Inevitability**: Once Muldrotha sticks for 2-3 turn cycles, you **will** out-resource opponents. Recurring Strip Mine, Spore Frog, Seal of Primordium creates **"how do we beat this?"** despair. Opponents must answer Muldrotha or lose slowly.

**2. Repetitive Lines**: Watching you cast Sakura-Tribe Elder from graveyard 6 turns in a row is **boring**. Muldrotha value is powerful but **visually monotonous**. Compare to explosive plays (Craterhoof, Army of the Damned).

**3. Long Turns**: With Muldrotha active, your turns take **2-3 minutes** (evaluating graveyard, choosing 3 permanents, sequencing). Opponents sit waiting. In multiplayer, this is **15-20% of game time** devoted to you.

**4. "Answer-or-Lose" Commanders**: Muldrotha is **kill-on-sight**. If opponents lack removal when she resolves, they lose. This creates **binary outcome** (remove her = you struggle; don't remove = you win). Not fun for either side.

**Comparison**: Decks like Chulane (similar power) have same issues. Commander-centric value engines create **inevitability**. This is **structural to archetype**, not your build.

---

### **Predictability: 6/10** (Moderate-High)

**Predictable elements**:

**1. Muldrotha in Command Zone**: Opponents know graveyard strategy from deck reveal. They mulligan for graveyard hate. They sandbag removal for Muldrotha.

**2. Win Conditions**: Altar loops are **visible** (opponents see Gravecrawler + Phyrexian Altar on board). Thoracle requires obvious setup (empty library). Value grind is **slow** (telegraphed over multiple turns).

**3. Optimal Lines**: Experienced opponents know you'll:
- Ramp turns 1-3
- Deploy Muldrotha turn 4-5
- Recur value permanents turns 6-8
- Win via altars or accumulated value turn 9-11

This is **predictable sequencing**.

**Unpredictable elements**:

**1. Tutor Targets**: 8 tutors mean opponents don't know what you fetched. Could be combo piece, answer, or value engine.

**2. Graveyard Contents**: Self-mill makes graveyard composition **variable**. Opponents can't track all 30+ cards milled. Hidden information advantages you.

**3. Which Win Path**: Do you win via altars (combo), Syr Konrad pings (gradual), Thoracle (instant)? Not telegraphed until assembled.

**Verdict**: Strategy is predictable (graveyard value → win). Tactics are less predictable (which cards, which line).

---

### **Pilot Difficulty: 7.5/10** (Medium-High)

**Skill Floor (Minimum Competency): 6/10**

**Basic play pattern** is learnable:
1. Ramp early
2. Cast Muldrotha
3. Recur permanents
4. Win via obvious combos

**New pilots can function** by following templated lines. Sakura-Tribe Elder from graveyard = correct 80% of time. Seal of Primordium when artifacts/enchantments exist = correct.

**Skill Ceiling (Mastery): 9/10**

**Optimal play requires**:

**1. Graveyard Math**: Tracking what's in graveyard (30+ cards), what's exiled, what's available to Muldrotha. Memory-intensive.

**2. Sequencing Optimization**: Choosing correct permanent type first (to enable second/third casts). Example: If you need Eternal Witness (creature) and Sakura-Tribe Elder (creature), which first? Witness returns instant from graveyard, Steve ramps. Optimal order: Steve first (ramp enables more casts), then Witness.

**3. Tutor Targets**: Knowing which card wins from position X requires **format knowledge**. Do you tutor Toxic Deluge (board wipe) or Cyclonic Rift (bounce)? Depends on opponent creatures (indestructible vs regeneration).

**4. Politics**: Convincing opponents to attack each other while Muldrotha grinds requires **social engineering**. "I'm not the threat, Player X has 30 cards in hand" deflection.

**5. Combo Assembly**: Knowing which altar + which creature + which payoff = win requires **pattern recognition**. There are 3 altars × 3 creatures × 2 payoffs = **18 possible lines**. Knowing which is assemblable from current board state = expertise.

**Common Piloting Mistakes**:

**Mistake 1**: Over-milling. New pilots mill aggressively, then deck themselves. Optimal mill rate is **controlled** (3-4 cards/turn, not 20).

**Mistake 2**: Casting Muldrotha into interaction. Experienced pilots **wait for shields down** (opponents tapped out, counterspells exhausted). New pilots jam Muldrotha turn 4, eat removal.

**Mistake 3**: Wrong permanent priorities. Casting Spore Frog (fog) vs Sakura-Tribe Elder (ramp) when you need ramp = misplay.

**Comparison**: Easier than stax (Derevi tax-math), harder than creature aggro (Najeela combat). Similar difficulty to other tutor-heavy value decks (Chulane, Tasigur).

---

## VI. Improvement Recommendations (Priority Ranked)

### **Tier 1: Critical Additions**

**1. Demonic Consultation** (for Thoracle escape hatch)
**Why**: Makes Oracle functional as 10% bailout. 2-card combo turn 6-7 beats stax/hate.
**What to Cut**: Haywire Mite (as you've identified). Seal of Primordium is broader (hits any artifact/enchantment).

**2. Endurance** (graveyard protection)
**Why**: Pitch-cast creature (0 mana) that shuffles graveyards into libraries. Protects your graveyard from Rest in Peace, Bojuka Bog. Can target opponents' graveyards for hate.
**What to Cut**: Consider Stitcher's Supplier (self-mill is less critical with better engines).

**3. +1 Land** (improve consistency)
**Why**: 6-mana commander needs reliable turns 1-6 land drops. 33 lands = ~85% chance hitting 6 lands by turn 6. 34 lands = ~90%.
**What to Cut**: Plaguecrafter (edict effect is medium power; slot better serves consistency).

---

### **Tier 2: Strong Considerations**

**4. Ledger Shredder** (card selection)
**Why**: 2-mana creature that connives (draw, discard, +1/+1) when anyone casts second spell/turn. Fills graveyard, filters draws, flying blocker.
**What to Cut**: Baleful Strix (card draw on ETB is one-time; Ledger is repeatable).

**5. Displacer Kitten** (value engine)
**Why**: Blinks permanents when you cast noncreature spell. With Muldrotha casting permanents from graveyard (noncreature spells), creates blink loops. Flicker Eternal Witness infinitely, etc.
**What to Cut**: Plaguecrafter or Bloodghast (if cutting edict or redundant loop piece).

---

### **Tier 3: Meta-Dependent**

**6. Nature's Claim** (instant artifact/enchantment removal)
**Why**: 1-mana instant destroys artifact/enchantment. Fastest answer to resolved Rest in Peace.
**What to Cut**: Depends on meta. If graveyard hate is prevalent, worth slot.

**7. Culling the Weak** (fast mana)
**Why**: Sacrifice creature, add {B}{B}{B}{B}. With recursive creatures (Gravecrawler, Bloodghast), this is **ritual** every turn. Enables turn 3-4 Muldrotha.
**What to Cut**: Arcane Signet or other 2-mana rock (fast mana > ramp at high power).

---

## VII. Pitch Creatures Reference

**Modern Horizons 2 Incarnation Cycle** (Zero-Mana Pitch Cards):

| Card | Colors | Normal Cost | Pitch Cost | Effect |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **Endurance** | Green | 2GG | Exile green card | Shuffle all graveyards into libraries, Flash, Reach |
| **Solitude** | White | 3WW | Exile white card | Exile target creature, Flash, Lifelink |
| **Subtlety** | Blue | 2UU | Exile blue card | Return creature/PW, counter if recast, Flash, Flying |
| **Grief** | Black | 2BB | Exile black card | Target opponent discards, Evoke synergy |
| **Fury** | Red | 3RR | Exile red card | 4 damage divided, Double Strike |

**Recommendation for Muldrotha**: **Endurance** (~$25) is perfect for protecting against graveyard hate while being recurrable. Can pitch green card at instant speed to save your graveyard from Rest in Peace or exile opponent graveyards.

---

## VIII. Final Assessment & Recommendations

### **Overall Deck Score: 8.0/10**

**Breakdown**:
- **Construction Quality**: 9/10 (excellent card choices, coherent strategy)
- **Power Level**: 8/10 (solid Bracket 4, competitive casual)
- **Strategy Execution**: 9/10 (achieves stated 70/20/10 goals)
- **Resilience**: 7/10 (vulnerable to graveyard hate, commander tax)
- **Fun Factor**: 7.5/10 (high pilot fun, moderate opponent fun)

### **Recommended For**

✅ **Experienced players** seeking technical, decision-rich gameplay
✅ **Competitive casual pods** (Bracket 4, power level 7-8)
✅ **Graveyard strategy enthusiasts** who enjoy recursion
✅ **Players who enjoy toolbox/tutor gameplay**
✅ **Playgroups with established power level** (not variance)

---

### **Not Recommended For**

❌ **New/casual players** (high complexity, long turns)
❌ **Battlecruiser pods** (power level 4-6, you're too strong)
❌ **Anti-combo playgroups** (altar loops will generate salt)
❌ **Players seeking fast wins** (games go 8-12 turns)
❌ **Groups that hate inevitability** (Muldrotha creates "answer or lose")

### **Final Verdict**

Your Muldrotha deck is **exceptionally well-constructed** for its stated goals. The 70/20/10 framework is achieved, card quality is high, and Muldrotha synergy is maximized. **This is a refined, competitive casual list** that will perform well at Bracket 4 tables.

**Primary weakness** is graveyard hate vulnerability—a structural limitation of the archetype, not your build. **Primary strength** is flexibility (multiple win paths) and consistency (excellent tutors, card draw).

**If you make only one change**: Add **Demonic Consultation**. This transforms Thoracle from "maybe win" to "2-card escape hatch," justifying the 10% allocation. Your initial instinct was correct—2% of deck for 10% of wins is efficient.

**Champion this deck if**: You want high-skill-ceiling, interaction-dense, graveyard-value gameplay with combo backup.

**Avoid this deck if**: You want simple patterns, fast wins, or low-salt gameplay.

**Rating: 8.0/10 - Excellent competitive casual build with minor optimization opportunities.**
