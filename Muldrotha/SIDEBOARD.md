## Strong Cards That Didn't Make the Cut

These cards were in Tier 2/3 consideration but lost out due to limited slots. All are worth testing.

### Ashiok, Dream Render
**Type**: Planeswalker
**Mana Cost**: 1UB
**EDHREC**: 38% inclusion, 34% synergy
**Why Consider**: Shuts down opponent tutors while milling yourself. The passive ability (opponents can't search libraries) is powerful hate against tutor-heavy strategies.
**Why It Didn't Make It**: With only 15 slots, prioritized card advantage engines over hate pieces.
**When to Add**:
- If your meta is tutor-heavy (lots of Demonic Tutor, Mystical Tutor, Vampiric Tutor)
- If you need more self-mill
- If you want to slow down fast combo
**What to Cut For It**: Seal of Primordium (if artifact/enchantment removal isn't critical in your meta)

---

### Siren Stormtamer
**Type**: Creature (Bird Pirate)
**Mana Cost**: U
**EDHREC**: 32% inclusion, 27% synergy
**Why Consider**: 1-mana creature that provides repeatable protection through Muldrotha. Sacrifice to counter spell targeting you or permanent you control. Excellent against targeted removal.
**Why It Didn't Make It**: Already have strong protection package (counterspells, Lightning Greaves)
**When to Add**:
- If your playgroup runs heavy targeted removal
- If Muldrotha keeps getting killed
- If you need more 1-drop creatures for Birthing Pod chains
**What to Cut For It**: Pact of Negation or Force of Negation (if you want creature-based protection)

---

### Displacer Kitten
**Type**: Creature (Cat Beast)
**Mana Cost**: 2U
**EDHREC**: 35% inclusion, 32% synergy
**Why Consider**: Blinks a permanent whenever you cast noncreature spell. With Muldrotha casting permanents from graveyard, creates value loops. Can blink Eternal Witness, Muldrotha herself, or ETB creatures.
**Why It Didn't Make It**: Value engine but not essential for core strategy
**When to Add**:
- If you want more ETB abuse
- If you're running more noncreature spells
- If you want additional combo potential (can enable infinite loops)
**What to Cut For It**: Plaguecrafter or Baleful Strix (if you want the blink value over immediate ETB)

---

### Mesmeric Orb
**Type**: Artifact
**Mana Cost**: 2
**EDHREC**: 30% inclusion, 18% synergy
**Why Consider**: Extremely efficient self-mill. Mills you one card for each permanent that untaps (yours AND opponents'). Fills graveyard rapidly in multiplayer.
**Why It Didn't Make It**: Aggressive self-mill can be risky, also mills opponents (helps graveyard decks)
**When to Add**:
- If you want faster graveyard filling
- If your meta doesn't have many graveyard decks
- If you're comfortable with the risk
**What to Cut For It**: Stitcher's Supplier or Satyr Wayfinder (if you want more aggressive mill)

---

### Oko, Thief of Crowns
**Type**: Planeswalker
**Mana Cost**: 1GU
**EDHREC**: 26% inclusion, 22% synergy
**Why Consider**: Powerful planeswalker recurrable through Muldrotha. +2 creates food tokens. +1 turns artifacts/creatures into 3/3 Elks (removes problematic permanents). Can be cast from graveyard.
**Why It Didn't Make It**: Planeswalker slot less synergistic than permanent types that benefit more from Muldrotha
**When to Add**:
- If your meta has problematic creatures (Dockside Extortionist, etc.)
- If you want repeatable permanent removal
- If you have room for additional value pieces
**What to Cut For It**: Plaguecrafter or Opposition Agent (if you want different removal angle)

---

### Caustic Caterpillar
**Type**: Creature (Insect)
**Mana Cost**: G
**EDHREC**: 35% inclusion, 32% synergy
**Why Consider**: 1-mana creature version of Haywire Mite. Destroys artifact or enchantment when sacrificed. Green makes it easier to cast early.
**Why It Didn't Make It**: Haywire Mite is artifact creature (dual type better for Muldrotha)
**When to Add**:
- If you want redundant artifact/enchantment removal
- If you need more 1-drops
- If you want to run both for maximum removal density
**What to Cut For It**: Could replace Haywire Mite OR run both (cut utility creature)

---

### Ledger Shredder
**Type**: Creature (Bird Advisor)
**Mana Cost**: 1U
**EDHREC**: Growing popularity in 2024-2025
**Why Consider**: Whenever player casts second spell in turn, connive (draw, discard, +1/+1 counter if discard is nonland). Fills graveyard while filtering draws. Flying blocker.
**Why It Didn't Make It**: Card selection is good but not as powerful as dedicated draw engines
**When to Add**:
- If you want more card selection
- If you value the flying body
- If you cast multiple spells per turn frequently
**What to Cut For It**: Satyr Wayfinder or Stitcher's Supplier (if you want selection over pure mill)

---

## Meta-Dependent Flex Slots

Cards to swap in based on your local metagame.

### Against Fast Combo Decks

**Add**:
- **Ashiok, Dream Render** - Stops tutors
- **Grafdigger's Cage** - Stops cast from graveyard/library combos
- **Cursed Totem** - Stops activated ability combos (beware: hurts your Muldrotha)

**Cut For Them**:
- Seal of Primordium, Haywire Mite (if combo uses fewer artifacts/enchantments)

---

### Against Graveyard-Heavy Meta

**Add**:
- **Soul-Guide Lantern** - Instant-speed graveyard exile, cantrips
- **Nihil Spellbomb** - Exiles graveyard, cantrips, recurrable
- **Scavenging Ooze** - Repeatable graveyard hate on body

**Cut For Them**:
- Bojuka Bog might not be enough on its own
- Consider cutting a value piece if graveyard hate is critical

---

### Against Stax/Tax Effects

**Add**:
- **Veil of Summer** (we cut this) - Excellent against blue/black stax
- **Heroic Intervention** - Protects your board from wipes
- **Teferi's Protection** - Ultimate protection (expensive)

**Cut For Them**:
- Some counterspells (if you need protection over interaction)

---

### Against Creature-Heavy Aggro

**Add**:
- **Massacre Girl** - Board wipe on creature
- **Plague Engineer** - Shuts down tribal strategies
- **Additional board wipes**

**Cut For Them**:
- Single-target creature removal may need to become board wipes

---

## Cards We Cut (Potential Re-Adds)

These cards were cut but could be reconsidered based on testing or preference.

### Windfall
**Why We Cut**: Not essential with better card draw engines
**Reconsider If**:
- You find you need burst draw more than sustained engines
- Your playgroup draws too many cards (disruption value)
- You want more graveyard filling
**Strong Against**: Control decks with full grips
**Weak Against**: Decks that want cards in hand (helps them)

---

### Necromancy
**Why We Cut**: Third reanimation spell is luxury
**Reconsider If**:
- Reanimation is critical to your strategy
- Flash-speed reanimation has won you games
- You face a lot of graveyard hate (want redundancy)
**Advantage**: Flash means instant-speed reanimation (combat tricks, end of turn)
**Disadvantage**: Costs 2B vs Animate Dead's 1B

---

### Mana Vault
**Why We Cut**: Fast mana but slot better used
**Reconsider If**:
- You consistently want Muldrotha on turn 3-4
- Your meta is fast and you need early acceleration
- You value fast mana over card advantage
**Advantage**: Turn 1 Mana Vault → Turn 2 Muldrotha is powerful
**Disadvantage**: Damages you, requires mana to untap

---

### Demonic Consultation
**Why We Cut**: Too narrow, only for Thoracle combo
**Reconsider If**:
- You want Thoracle combo to be more consistent (15% of strategy instead of 10%)
- Your meta requires fast combo wins
- You're moving toward more competitive play
**Advantage**: Compact 2-card win with Thassa's Oracle
**Disadvantage**: Dead card without Oracle, signals combo intent

---

### Pitiless Plunderer
**Why We Cut**: Not essential for altar combos
**Reconsider If**:
- You want more treasure generation
- You're running more sacrifice effects
- You want additional redundancy for altar loops
**Advantage**: Creates mana when creatures die (value)
**Disadvantage**: 4 mana is expensive for effect that requires setup

---

### Crop Rotation
**Why We Cut**: Utility land tutor not essential
**Reconsider If**:
- You add more critical utility lands (Cabal Coffers, etc.)
- Instant-speed land tutoring has been critical
- You value the versatility
**Advantage**: Instant speed, finds Bojuka Bog, Strip Mine, etc.
**Disadvantage**: Sacrifices a land (tempo loss)

---

### Veil of Summer
**Why We Cut**: Meta-dependent, narrow
**Reconsider If**:
- Your meta is heavy blue/black control
- You face lots of counterspells
- You need cheap protection
**Advantage**: 1 mana, draws a card, protects against blue/black
**Disadvantage**: Dead against non-blue/black decks

---

## Budget Alternatives

If you can't afford the expensive cards, these are solid substitutes.

### For Force of Will (~$90)
**Alternatives**:
- **Force of Negation** (~$50) - Already in deck, exiles itself
- **Pact of Negation** (~$20) - Already in deck, zero mana
- **Fierce Guardianship** (~$40) - Already in deck
**Assessment**: You already have 3 free counterspells. Force of Will is luxury.

---

### For Vampiric Tutor (~$40)
**Alternatives**:
- **Mystical Tutor** (~$15) - Already in deck, instant/sorcery only
- **Worldly Tutor** (~$15) - Already in deck, creature only
- **Imperial Seal** (~$40-200) - Similar effect but sorcery speed
**Assessment**: Specific tutors (Mystical, Worldly, Entomb, Buried Alive) cover most needs

---

### For Demonic Tutor (~$30)
**Alternatives**:
- **Diabolic Tutor** (~$1) - 4 mana version, slower but functional
- **Grim Tutor** (~$15) - 3 mana, lose 3 life
- **Beseech the Mirror** (~$5) - 4 mana but free if you bargained
**Assessment**: Demonic Tutor's efficiency (2 mana) is worth the cost at Bracket 4

---

### For Birthing Pod (~$20)
**Alternatives**:
- **Prime Speaker Vannifar** (~$5) - Creature version, more vulnerable
- **Eldritch Evolution** (~$5) - One-time use, sorcery
- **Neoform** (~$2) - One-time use, cheaper CMC
**Assessment**: Pod's repeatability is worth the cost, but Vannifar is solid budget option

---

### For Survival of the Fittest (~$300+)
**Already in deck but if you need to cut for budget**:
- **Fauna Shaman** (~$8) - Creature version, same effect
- **Cryptbreaker** (~$3) - Zombie tribal, creates zombies
- **Wild Pair** (~$2) - Different angle, creatures tutor creatures
**Assessment**: Survival is powerful but not essential. Fauna Shaman is 80% as good.

---

### For Mana Drain (~$80)
**Already in deck but if you need to cut**:
- **Counterspell** (~$2) - Already in deck, no mana upside but functional
- **Arcane Denial** (~$3) - Cheap counter, opponents draw cards
- **Negate** (~$0.25) - Noncreature spells only
**Assessment**: Mana Drain's upside is luxury. Counterspell is fine.

---

## Power Level Adjustments

### To Move Deck to 8.5-9/10 (Toward cEDH)

**Add**:
- **Mana Crypt** (~$200) - Essential fast mana
- **Demonic Consultation** - Consistent Thoracle wins
- **Imperial Seal** - Second Vampiric Tutor
- **Dockside Extortionist** (~$80) - Treasure generation
- **Culling the Weak** - Fast mana

---

**Strategy Shift**: 90% midrange / 10% altars / 0% combo

---

## Testing Candidates

Cards worth acquiring and testing before committing.

### Tier 1 Testing (Likely Good)
1. **Ashiok, Dream Render** - Hate piece + self-mill
2. **Siren Stormtamer** - Protection
3. **Caustic Caterpillar** - Redundant removal
4. **Ledger Shredder** - Card selection

### Tier 2 Testing (Maybe Good)
1. **Displacer Kitten** - Blink value
2. **Mesmeric Orb** - Aggressive mill
3. **Oko, Thief of Crowns** - Removal + value
4. **Windfall** (we cut it) - Burst draw + disruption

### Tier 3 Testing (Experimental)
1. **Underrealm Lich** - Card selection + mill
2. **Tamiyo, Collector of Tales** - Passive protection + recursion
3. **Kaya's Guile** - Modal flexibility
4. **Primal Surge** - All-in build-around (would require no other instants/sorceries)

## Final Notes

### Philosophy

This sideboard is organized around **flexibility and meta-adaptation**. The main deck is tuned for a balanced competitive casual environment. Use this sideboard to:

1. **Test alternatives** before committing to expensive purchases
2. **Adapt to your meta** when you know what you'll face
3. **Adjust power level** up or down based on playgroup
4. **Find budget options** when upgrading incrementally

### Recommendation

Start with the main 100 cards as presented. After 10-15 games, identify:
- What's underperforming
- What gaps exist
- What your meta demands

Then consult this sideboard for targeted swaps.

### Living Document

As new sets release and your meta evolves, update this sideboard. Cards in Tier 1 testing may graduate to main deck. Cards in main deck may move here if they underperform.

**Good luck, and may your graveyard be ever fruitful!**
