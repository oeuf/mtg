| **Commander** | 1 | 1% | 1 | ✅ |

### Mana Sources Analysis

| Category | Count | Recommended | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Total Lands** | 34 | 35-37 | Consider +1-2 lands |
| **Mana Rocks** | 5 | 6-10 | Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, Lotus Petal, Mana Vault (SB), The One Ring |
| **Mana Dorks** | 2 | 2-4 | Bloom Tender, Deathrite Shaman (SB) |
| **Land Ramp** | 3 | 3-5 | Nature's Lore, Sakura-Tribe Elder, Exploration |
| **Total Ramp** | 10 | 10-14 | ✅ Adequate |

### Color Fixing Assessment

Your mana base is **well-constructed** for a 3-color deck:
- **4 Fetch lands**: Misty Rainforest, Verdant Catacombs, Polluted Delta + implicit fetching
- **3 Shock lands**: Breeding Pool, Watery Grave, Overgrown Tomb
- **6 Other duals**: Morphic Pool, Rejuvenating Springs, Drowned Catacomb, Woodland Cemetery, Hinterland Harbor, Shipwreck Marsh
- **2 Rainbow lands**: Command Tower, (Urborg + Yavimaya combo)
- **1 Pain land**: Underground River, Llanowar Wastes

**Recommendation**: Your fixing is strong. The Urborg + Yavimaya combo is clever for color fixing.

- Efficient tutors (Vampiric, Worldly, Mystical, Entomb, Buried Alive)
- Premium fast mana (Ancient Tomb, Lotus Petal, Sol Ring)

---

## Part 1: Sultai Commander Swap Analysis

### Overview

Your deck already contains several Sultai legends that could helm the deck:
- **Sidisi, Brood Tyrant** (in main deck)
- **Tasigur, the Golden Fang** (in main deck)
- **Yarok, the Desecrated** (in main deck)
- **Glarb, Calamity's Augur** (in main deck)
- **Teval, the Balanced Scale** (in main deck)

This is excellent deck construction—you can literally swap commanders with **zero card changes**.

---

### 1. Tasigur, the Golden Fang

**Currently in your deck: YES ✅**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Mana Cost** | 5B (Delve reduces to 1B typically) |
| **Strategy** | Control/Combo, Political recursion |
| **Power Level** | cEDH viable |
| **EDHREC Rank** | #89 (6,200+ decks) |

**Cards to Keep (High Synergy):**
| Card | Synergy Reason |
|------|----------------|
| Demonic Consultation | Wins with Thoracle |
| Thassa's Oracle | Primary win condition |
| Counterspell suite (all 9) | Control shell essential |
| Mystic Remora, Rhystic Study | Card advantage |
| Life from the Loam | Fills graveyard for Delve |
| Reality Shift | Creates loop with Tasigur activation |

**Cards with Reduced Value:**
| Card | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Secrets of the Dead | Less self-mill focus |
| River Kelpie | Fewer cast-from-graveyard triggers |
| Kaya's Ghostform | Less commander-dependent |

**Swap Cost: $0** (already in deck)
**Cards Changed: 0-3**

**Playstyle Shift**: More controlling, more political. You activate Tasigur to "ask" opponents which card to return, creating table dynamics. The Consultation/Thoracle combo remains your primary win.

---

### 2. Sidisi, Brood Tyrant

**Currently in your deck: YES ✅**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Mana Cost** | 1BGU |
| **Strategy** | Self-mill, Zombie tokens, Aggro-combo |
| **Power Level** | Mid to High |
| **EDHREC Rank** | #118 (7,400+ decks) |

**Cards to Keep (High Synergy):**
| Card | Synergy Reason |
|------|----------------|
| Mesmeric Orb (SB) | All-star—each untap = Sidisi trigger |
| Altar of Dementia | Mill + sac outlet |
| Stitcher's Supplier (SB) | Mill on ETB and death |
| Satyr Wayfinder (SB) | Mill + land to hand |
| Gravecrawler | Zombie synergy + recurring threat |
| Bloodghast | Recurring creature for mill value |
| Life from the Loam | Dredge fuels Sidisi |

**Cards with Reduced Value:**
| Card | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Secrets of the Dead | Fewer cast-from-graveyard effects |
| Most enchantments | Sidisi wants creature density (50%+) |
| Non-creature ramp | Replace with Wood Elves, Farhaven Elf |

**Swap Cost: $0** (already in deck)
**Recommended Additions from Sideboard**: Mesmeric Orb, Stitcher's Supplier, Satyr Wayfinder
**Cards Changed: 5-10** (swap instants/sorceries for creatures)

**Playstyle Shift**: More aggressive, more creature-focused. You want 45-50 creatures for consistent Sidisi triggers. Consider adding Snarling Gorehound, Altar of the Brood.

---

### 3. Yarok, the Desecrated

**Currently in your deck: YES ✅**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Mana Cost** | 3BGU |
| **Strategy** | ETB value, Combo |
| **Power Level** | High |
| **EDHREC Rank** | #25 (15,000+ decks) |

**Cards to Keep (High Synergy):**
| Card | Synergy Reason |
|------|----------------|
| Mulldrifter | Draw 4 cards |
| Plaguecrafter | Double edict effect |
| Eternal Witness | Return 2 cards |
| Opposition Agent | Double flash trigger |
| Sakura-Tribe Elder | Ramp 2 lands |
| Baleful Strix | Draw 2, deathtouch |
| Thassa's Oracle | Double trigger = easier win |

**Cards with Reduced Value:**
| Card | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Survival of the Fittest | Not ETB focused |
| Gravecrawler | No ETB |
| Bloodghast | No ETB |
| Secrets of the Dead | Wrong trigger type |

**Swap Cost: $0** (already in deck)
**Cards Changed: 8-12**

**Recommended Adds for Yarok:**
- Panharmonicon ($8)
- Peregrine Drake ($0.50) - goes infinite with Deadeye Navigator
- Palinchron ($25) - instant infinite mana
- Deadeye Navigator ($5)
- Risen Reef ($2)
- Shrieking Drake ($0.25) - infinite ETBs with cost reducers

**Playstyle Shift**: More explosive value turns. Less graveyard-dependent, more resilient to grave hate. Combos differently—usually infinite mana + draw into Thoracle.

---

### 4. Glarb, Calamity's Augur

**Currently in your deck: YES ✅**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Mana Cost** | 1BGU |
| **Strategy** | Surveil value, Top-deck manipulation |
| **Power Level** | Mid-High |
| **EDHREC Rank** | New (Bloomburrow) |

**Cards to Keep (High Synergy):**
| Card | Synergy Reason |
|------|----------------|
| Sylvan Library | Top-deck synergy |
| Ledger Shredder (SB) | Connive synergy |
| All graveyard payoffs | Surveil fills yard |
| Fetchlands | Shuffle after surveil |

**Cards with Reduced Value:**
| Card | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Self-mill cards | Surveil is more controlled |
| Aggressive graveyard fillers | Less explosive milling |

**Swap Cost: $0** (already in deck)
**Cards Changed: 3-5**

**Playstyle Shift**: More controlling, more surgical graveyard filling. You always know what's coming and can plan accordingly.

---

### 5. Teval, the Balanced Scale

**Currently in your deck: YES ✅**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Mana Cost** | 2BGU |
| **Strategy** | Reanimator, Graveyard value |
| **Power Level** | High |
| **EDHREC Rank** | New (Tarkir: Dragonstorm 2025) |

**Cards to Keep (High Synergy):**
| Card | Synergy Reason |
|------|----------------|
| All reanimation spells | Core strategy |
| Self-mill package | Fills yard for Teval |
| Fetch lands | Teval returns lands |
| Bloodghast, Gravecrawler | Trigger "leaves graveyard" |
| Altar of Dementia | Sac outlet + mill |

**Why Teval May Be Better Than Muldrotha:**
1. **Lower CMC**: 4 vs 6 mana
2. **Built-in mill**: ETB mills 4
3. **Token generation**: 1/1 when cards leave yard
4. **Land recursion**: Returns a land automatically

**Swap Cost: $0** (already in deck)
**Cards Changed: 0-2**

**Playstyle Shift**: Very similar to Muldrotha but faster and with token generation. Less flexible (only returns lands automatically) but more resilient.

## Expert Recommendations

### From Draftsim's Muldrotha Guide:
> "Muldrotha's biggest downfall is being 6cmc with no way to reduce the cost. No matter how strong you want to build this deck, it's always going to be on the slower side."

### From CoolStuffInc's Top 5 Sultai Commanders (2025):
> "Teval does more than Muldrotha: he mills, reanimates a land, and rewards you with a token when a card leaves the graveyard. This is the newest option and specifically designed for graveyard strategies."

### From MTG Salvation Forums:
> "Yarok is more versatile and less susceptible to graveyard hate, unlike Muldrotha."

### From TappedOut Primer:
> "Every time a new Muldrotha enters the battlefield, it does not retain information from previous versions. So when you cast Phantasmal Image and it becomes a Muldrotha, you're able to cast an entire new set of permanents."

---

## Final Recommendations

### If You Want Minimal Changes:
**Teval, the Balanced Scale** — Already in your deck. Functionally similar to Muldrotha but:
- 2 mana cheaper
- Built-in mill
- Token generation
- More resilient gameplan

### If You Want Higher Power:
**Tasigur, the Golden Fang** — Already in your deck. Your control package and Consultation/Oracle combo are already optimized for Tasigur.

### If You Want a Different Experience (Still Sultai):
**Yarok, the Desecrated** — Requires ~$30-50 in new ETB creatures but plays completely differently. More explosive, less graveyard-dependent.

### If You Want to Build Simic:
**Tatyova, Benthic Druid** — Already in your sideboard. Reuses the most cards from your Muldrotha shell (lands, land-recursion, counters). The Landfall combo is consistent and powerful.
