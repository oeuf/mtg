## Your Deck: Card Type Distribution

### Main Deck Breakdown (100 cards)

| Card Type | Your Count | EDHREC Average | Notes |
|-----------|------------|----------------|-------|
| **Lands** | 34 | 29 ([source](https://edhrec.com/articles/superior-numbers-land-counts)) | You're above average |
| **Basics** | 10 | Varies | Standard for 3-color |
| **Creatures** | 24 | ~25-30 | Reasonable |
| **Artifacts** | 9 | ~8-10 | Normal |
| **Enchantments** | 10 | ~8-10 | Normal |
| **Instants** | 15 | ~8-10 | High (control build) |
| **Sorceries** | 6 | ~6-8 | Normal |
| **Mana Rocks** | 4-5 | 4 ([source](https://edhrec.com/articles/superior-numbers-land-counts)) | Average |

### What the Data Actually Says About Land Counts

From [EDHREC's Superior Numbers column](https://edhrec.com/articles/superior-numbers-land-counts):
> "The average deck on EDHREC is running 29 lands and four mana rocks... 29 lands and 4 rocks feels really, really low."

**Nate Burgess Formula** (cited in EDHREC):
> Number of lands = 31 + (colors in identity) + (commander CMC)
> For Muldrotha: 31 + 3 + 6 = **40 lands**

From [CoolStuffInc's Ramp Guide by Mark Wischkaemper](https://www.coolstuffinc.com/a/markwischkaemper-06222023-how-much-ramp-is-right-for-your-commander-deck):
> "The typical number of mana sources you should run is 43 to 55 total. Aim for between 33-40 lands and your mana rocks and other sources should be 10-15."

**Your deck: 34 lands + ~10 ramp sources = 44 total mana sources** — within recommended range.

### What the Data Says About Mana Rocks

From [Draftsim's Mana Rock Guide](https://draftsim.com/how-many-mana-rocks-edh/):
> "A lot of deck formulas prescribe 10-12 ramp spells, including mana rocks, mana dorks, sorceries, etc."
> "Typically around eight rocks is common, with more for commanders with high mana costs."

From [EDHREC Mana Rock Rankings](https://edhrec.com/articles/ranking-every-mana-rock-with-edhrec-finale-the-top-nine-mana-rocks-and-sol-ring):
> "Sol Ring is the only card on EDHREC to be in more than 300,000 decks."
> "Arcane Signet feels like it outclasses both [Signets and Talismans] because it functions like a Command Tower."

**Note:** Mana Crypt was banned in Commander in 2024.

## Part 1: Sultai Commander Swap Analysis

### Key Insight: Your Deck Contains 5 Alternate Commanders

Your deck already includes: **Sidisi, Tasigur, Yarok, Glarb, and Teval** in the 99.

---

### 1. Tasigur, the Golden Fang

**EDHREC Data:** 6,200+ decks

**From [EDHREC Commander Showdown: Muldrotha vs Tasigur](https://articles.edhrec.com/commander-showdown-muldrotha-vs-tasigur/):**

> "Comparing Tasigur to Muldrotha is somewhat disingenuous—while at first glance, they're both Sultai recursion commanders, in spirit, they're entirely separate animals."

> "Tasigur is far more similar to Thrasios, Triton Hero in intention, controlling the board until an infinite mana combo puts your entire deck into your hand."

> "Since Tasigur runs so many classic Sultai removal spells (sometimes criticized as 'goodstuff' cards), it makes him appear less unique than some others."

**From [MTGNexus Tasigur Primer](https://www.mtgnexus.com/viewtopic.php?t=893):**
> "Tasigur lists heavily rely on Birthing Pod or cards with similar effects like Food Chain."

**Your Cards That Synergize:**
- Demonic Consultation + Thassa's Oracle (your existing win condition works perfectly)
- Your 9 counterspells are ideal for Tasigur control
- Birthing Pod (in your deck)
- Life from the Loam fills graveyard for Delve

**Cards That Lose Value:**
- Secrets of the Dead, River Kelpie (fewer graveyard casts)
- Kaya's Ghostform (Tasigur is cheap to recast anyway)

**Swap Assessment:** 0-3 cards changed. Your deck is already well-suited for Tasigur.

---

### 2. Sidisi, Brood Tyrant

**EDHREC Data:** 7,467 decks, ranked #260 ([source](https://edhrec.com/commanders/sidisi-brood-tyrant))

**From [MTG Salvation Sidisi Primer](https://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/commander-edh/multiplayer-commander-decklists/571213-sidisi-brood-tyrant-zombie-horde-and-shenanigans-3):**

> "Mesmeric Orb is an all-star in the deck—it mills opponents and yourself, and each instance is a separate trigger which Sidisi, Brood Tyrant loves."

> "Sidisi's ability triggers only when a creature card gets put into your graveyard from your library, not based on quantity—even if hit with Traumatize, you'll only generate a single 2/2 zombie."

**Optimal Creature Density:**
> "A commonly suggested ratio is 1:3 for creature cards (approximately 33% of the deck) in order to maintain the probability of self-milling a creature."

**Your Deck Problem:** You have 24 creatures (24%). Sidisi wants ~33 creatures (33+ cards).

**Cards That Synergize:**
- Mesmeric Orb (in your sideboard) — essential for Sidisi
- Altar of Dementia
- Stitcher's Supplier (sideboard)
- Gravecrawler (Zombie synergy)
- Life from the Loam (Dredge)

**Cards That Lose Value:**
- Most of your 15 instants (Sidisi wants creature density)
- Non-creature ramp

**Swap Assessment:** 10-15 cards changed. You need significantly more creatures.

---

### 3. Yarok, the Desecrated

**EDHREC Data:** 15,000+ decks, ranked #25

**From [EDHREC Commander Showdown: Muldrotha vs Yarok](https://articles.edhrec.com/commander-showdown-muldrotha-vs-yarok/):**

> "The fundamental question is whether you want Muldrotha to revive things from your graveyard to re-trigger their enter-the-battlefield effects, or Yarok to re-trigger those effects right away."

> "Where Muldrotha is the tortoise, moving slow and steady and inexorable toward victory, Yarok is the hare, leaping toward the finish line in crazy bursts of value."

> "Yarok, the Desecrated is nuts. To call this a Panharmonicon commander is accurate, but misses a few fine details."

**Specific Card Recommendations from the Article:**
- **Necromancy** (in your sideboard): "has an ETB trigger that turns it into an Aura, which Yarok doubles, allowing you to grab two creatures from graveyards simultaneously."
- **Stone-Seeder Hierophant**: "untaps twice whenever you play a land"

**From [TappedOut Forum](https://tappedout.net/mtg-forum/commander/muldrotha-vs-yarok/):**
> "Yarok is pretty spicy, and does things none of the others do. It is more versatile and less susceptible to [graveyard] hate, unlike Muldrotha."

**Your Cards That Synergize (ETB creatures):**
- Mulldrifter (draw 4)
- Plaguecrafter (double edict)
- Eternal Witness (return 2 cards)
- Sakura-Tribe Elder (ramp 2 lands)
- Baleful Strix (draw 2)
- Thassa's Oracle (double trigger wins easier)

**Cards That Lose Value:**
- Gravecrawler, Bloodghast (no ETB)
- Secrets of the Dead (wrong trigger)
- Survival of the Fittest (not ETB focused)

**Swap Assessment:** 8-12 cards changed. Add ETB creatures, cut graveyard recursion that doesn't ETB.

---

### 4. Glarb, Calamity's Augur

**EDHREC Data:** 17,586 decks ([source](https://edhrec.com/commanders/glarb-calamitys-augur))

**From [CoolStuffInc: Casting Big Stuff with Glarb by Abe Sargent](https://www.coolstuffinc.com/a/abesargent-08142024-casting-big-stuff-with-glarb-calamitys-augur-in-commander):**

> "A Glarb deck is all about using Glarb's effect to make the most of the abilities of your other creatures. If you enjoy having an open-ended commander with tons of different options and utility, Glarb is the commander for you."

**From [TheGamer Glarb Guide](https://www.thegamer.com/magic-the-gathering-glarb-calamitys-augur-commander-deck-guide/):**

> "You can use Glarb's surveil ability at any point so long as it isn't tapped. It is best to use it during the end step before you start your turn."

> "The ability to play lands from the top of your library is the main attraction, especially when combined with cards that let you play multiple lands a turn."

**From [Commander's Herald Max Power Glarb](https://commandersherald.com/max-power-glarb-calamitys-augur/):**

> "There is an adage when it comes to Competitive EDH commanders: to be considered, a cEDH commander needs to either provide card advantage, ramp, or be part of a two-card combo. Glarb is noted as potentially doing almost all three."

**Your Cards That Synergize:**
- Sylvan Library (top-deck manipulation)
- Fetchlands (shuffle after surveil)
- Exploration (play extra lands from top)
- Ledger Shredder (sideboard — connive synergy)

**Swap Assessment:** 3-5 cards changed. Glarb is more controlling, less explosive.

---

### 5. Teval, the Balanced Scale

**EDHREC Data:** New commander from Tarkir: Dragonstorm 2025

**From [CoolStuffInc: Teval, the Balanced Scale by Julian Sison](https://www.coolstuffinc.com/a/juiliansison-seo-03312025-teval-the-balanced-scale-sultais-newest-graveyard-menace):**

> "Most graveyard commanders care about what's inside the yard (like Muldrotha), but Teval actually pays you for taking things out. This opens up a new angle that takes advantage of effects that exile, reanimate, or otherwise interact with the yard in ways other decks don't."

> "Teval's effect triggers for each instance of a card leaving your graveyard and is not once per turn. This means you can keep utilizing Teval to generate a ton of Zombie tokens."

**From [CoolStuffInc Top 5 Sultai Commanders 2025](https://www.coolstuffinc.com/a/juliansison-seo-04092025-the-top-5-sultai-commanders):**

> "One of the biggest surprises in 2025 was Muldrotha, the Gravetide being dethroned from the Sultai reanimator throne. Teval does more: he mills, reanimates (a land), and also rewards you with a token when a card leaves the graveyard."

**From [EDHREC Teval page](https://edhrec.com/commanders/teval-the-balanced-scale):**
> In Teval decks, Muldrotha appears in 48% of decks with +29% synergy.
> In upgraded Teval reanimator builds, Muldrotha appears in 65% of decks with +47% synergy.

**Why Teval May Be Better Than Muldrotha:**
1. **CMC**: 4 vs 6 mana
2. **ETB mill**: Mills 4 cards when entering
3. **Not once-per-turn**: Token generation stacks
4. **Built-in land recursion**

**Your Cards That Synergize:**
- Bloodghast, Gravecrawler (trigger "leaves graveyard" repeatedly)
- Animate Dead, Reanimate, Necromancy (all trigger Teval)
- Altar of Dementia (mill + sac)
- Fetchlands (return with Teval)

**Swap Assessment:** 0-2 cards changed. Nearly identical playstyle to Muldrotha.

---

## Part 2: Simic Commander Swap Analysis

**Critical Note:** Dropping black loses ~25-28 cards including:
- Tutors: Vampiric Tutor, Demonic Consultation, Entomb, Buried Alive
- Reanimation: Reanimate, Animate Dead, Necromancy
- Removal: Toxic Deluge, Assassin's Trophy
- Value: Opposition Agent, Orcish Bowmasters, Dauthi Voidwalker

---

### 1. Tatyova, Benthic Druid

**EDHREC Data:** 7,900+ decks, ranked #243

**From [EDHREC Nearly Identical: Tatyova or Aesi](https://edhrec.com/articles/nearly-identical-tatyova-or-aesi):**

> "Based on data provided by MtGDS, Tatyova and Aesi have a similarity coefficient of 90%."

> "Tatyova felt like the quintessential Simic commander, as she cares about getting lands into play and drawing cards."

**From [Moxfield cEDH Tatyova Primer](https://moxfield.com/decks/ZURT8jgaeUencfkulYRNlA/primer):**

> "cEDH Tatyova Combo allows the basic mechanic of playing lands to be used as a card draw and mana ramp engine, as you don't need to spend mana to play lands. You can cast Tatyova as early as turn 1 and win as early as turns 3-4."

**Combo Line (from [TappedOut Tatyova Primer](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/tatyova-benthic-druid-primer/)):**
> "Tatyova + Walking Atlas/Sakura-Tribe Scout + Simic Growth Chamber/Oboro, Palace in the Clouds + Retreat to Coralhelm: Tap one of the creatures to put a bounce land onto the battlefield. The land entering triggers Tatyova and Retreat to Coralhelm. Use Coralhelm to untap the creature and repeat to draw your entire library."

**Your Cards That Transfer:**
- Exploration, Life from the Loam, Ramunap Excavator
- All fetchlands (landfall triggers)
- Mystic Remora, Rhystic Study
- Cyclonic Rift, blue counterspells
- Thassa's Oracle (win after drawing deck)

**Cards You Need to Add:**
- Retreat to Coralhelm (~$3)
- Simic Growth Chamber (~$0.25)
- Walking Atlas (~$1)
- Sakura-Tribe Scout (~$2)

**Swap Assessment:** ~25-30 cards changed. Estimated cost: $50-100.

---

### 2. Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy

**EDHREC Data:** 6,800+ decks, ranked #52

**From [Learn cEDH: Kinnan](https://learncedh.com/decklists/kinnan):**

> "Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy is a dynamic and proactive commander that leverages explosive mana production and infinite mana combos to dominate cEDH tables."

**From [EDHREC Combos: Kinnan + Basalt Monolith](https://edhrec.com/combos/simic/129-4131):**

> "This combo produces infinite colorless mana and appears in over 39,386 decks."

**The Combo (from [Commander Spellbook](https://commanderspellbook.com/combo/129-4131/)):**
> "With Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy in play: Cast Basalt Monolith, tap it for 4 mana (3 + 1 from Kinnan's ability), activate Basalt Monolith's second ability to untap it leaving 1 mana floating. Repeat to create infinite colorless mana."

**From [TheGamer Kinnan cEDH Guide](https://www.thegamer.com/magic-the-gathering-mtg-kinan-bonder-prodigy-cedh-deck-guide/):**

> "Basalt Monolith gives you infinite colorless mana, but since Kinnan requires colored mana for his ability, you cannot win without a mana sink."
> "You can use that infinite mana to feed into Kinnan's other ability to get non-Humans on the battlefield. When you have infinite mana, you can continuously use this ability to play through your entire deck and eventually get Thrasios, Triton Hero on the battlefield."

**Your Cards That Transfer:**
- Sol Ring (taps for 4 with Kinnan)
- Arcane Signet (taps for 4)
- Mana Vault (sideboard — taps for 6)
- Bloom Tender (taps for 6+)
- Thassa's Oracle (win condition)

**Critical Addition:**
- Basalt Monolith (~$2) — **THIS IS THE COMBO PIECE**

**Swap Assessment:** ~35-40 cards changed. Completely different deck. Cost: $80-150.

---

### 3. Aesi, Tyrant of Gyre Strait

**EDHREC Data:** 9,500+ decks (most-built Simic commander)

**From [EDHREC Nearly Identical: Tatyova or Aesi](https://edhrec.com/articles/nearly-identical-tatyova-or-aesi):**

> "Aesi currently rules as the most built Simic commander, with 7,000 decks—twice the number of decks that Tatyova has."

> "Aesi may cost one more mana, but being able to play an additional land for a turn and draw two cards is a whole world of a difference."

> "It's no surprise that having a commander that can ramp you in the command zone is better than gaining one life."

**Aesi vs Tatyova:**
| Attribute | Aesi | Tatyova |
|-----------|------|---------|
| CMC | 6 | 5 |
| Extra land drop | Yes (built-in) | No |
| Lifegain | No | Yes |
| Body | 5/5 | 3/3 |
| Cards drawn per land | 1 | 1 |

**Swap Assessment:** Similar to Tatyova. ~25-30 cards changed. Cost: $40-80.

---

### 4. Rashmi, Eternities Crafter

**EDHREC Data:** 4,200+ decks

**From [Moxfield Rashmi Primer "Embrace Eternity"](https://moxfield.com/decks/iwlYb-Moq0CbTyM11XdZyQ/primer):**

> "'Embrace Eternity' is a cascade & control deck focused on top deck manipulation, cascading frequently and playing cards/generating value on each opponent's turn. The primary engine pieces are Seedborn Muse & Leyline of Anticipation / Vedalken Orrery."

**From [Moxfield Rashmi Draw-Go](https://moxfield.com/decks/k120PKGfZEC4FAwuGoQu6g):**

> "Rashmi falls into an unusual cEDH archetype, Draw-Go. Unlike other cEDH decks, you do not lose value when countering spells because Rashmi allows you to break the typical disadvantage of counterspells."

**From [TappedOut Rashmi Control Primer](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/ok-in-response-im-going-to-cast/):**

> "Counterspell becomes Dismiss with her on the battlefield, or better. You could Counterspell and get a free Coiling Oracle for instance."

**Why Your Deck Works for Rashmi:**
Your 15 instants + heavy counterspell suite means you trigger Rashmi on every player's turn. Your existing:
- Mystical Tutor, Worldly Tutor (stack top of library)
- Sylvan Library (top-deck manipulation)
- Seedborn Muse (sideboard) — cast on each player's turn

**Swap Assessment:** ~30-35 cards changed. Cost: $60-100.

---

### 5. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath

**EDHREC Data:** 1,985 decks

**From [MTGGoldfish Commander Spotlight: Uro](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/commander-spotlight-uro-titan-of-nature-s-wrath):**

> "Escape is what makes Uro really powerful—it allows you to swing with an undercosted 6/6 that repeatedly gives you Growth Spiral-like value."

> "To fill the graveyard, you want to play as many fetchlands as possible and supplement with cantrips like Brainstorm or Thought Scour, plus ramp spells."

**From [CoolStuffInc Around the Wheel: Uro by Mark Wischkaemper](https://www.coolstuffinc.com/a/markwischkaemper-03042020-around-the-wheel-uro-titan-of-natures-wrath):**

> "You can discard Uro with cards like Frantic Search and Windfall, pitch him to tutors like Survival of the Fittest and Fauna Shaman, mill him with Mesmeric Orb and Satyr Wayfinder, or tutor him directly to the graveyard with Entomb and Buried Alive."

**Your Cards That Transfer:**
- Survival of the Fittest (discard Uro directly)
- Life from the Loam (dredge + lands)
- Ramunap Excavator
- Fetchlands (fill graveyard + extra land value)
- Exploration

**Swap Assessment:** ~30-35 cards changed. Cost: $50-90 (Uro ~$15).

## Muldrotha Combo Lines (From cEDH Primers)

### Lion's Eye Diamond Combo

**From [Commander Spellbook](https://commanderspellbook.com/combo/624-3518-3605-5131/) and [Moxfield Primer](https://moxfield.com/decks/446L-ip5kEqMfF4T2-EwDQ/primer):**

**Requirements:** Muldrotha + Lion's Eye Diamond + Dance of the Dead/Animate Dead + Phantasmal Image

**Loop:**
1. Phantasmal Image enters as copy of Muldrotha
2. Legend rule sends original Muldrotha to graveyard
3. Cast LED from graveyard (costs 0), crack for 3 mana
4. Cast Dance of the Dead from graveyard targeting Muldrotha
5. Muldrotha returns, legend rule sends Image to graveyard
6. Repeat — net +1 mana each loop

**Result:** Infinite mana, infinite ETB/LTB, infinite storm count.

### Displacer Kitten Combo

**From [EDHREC Combos](https://edhrec.com/combos/muldrotha-the-gravetide):**

> "With Muldrotha & Kitten in play, play Lion's Eye Diamond. Kitten flickers Muldrotha, resetting the count of artifacts you can play from the graveyard. Sacrifice Lion's Eye Diamond for mana, then replay Lion's Eye Diamond. Rinse & repeat for infinite colored mana."

**Note:** You have Displacer Kitten in your sideboard.

### Thoracle Consultation

**From [EDHREC Combos](https://edhrec.com/combos/dimir/742-1295):**

> "The Demonic Consultation + Thassa's Oracle combo appears in 129,792 decks (6.84% of 1,898,268 decks tracked)."

**From [Learn cEDH: When To Play Thassa's Oracle](https://learncedh.com/intermediate-course/when-to-play-thassas-oracle):**

> "Unlike Lab Man and Jace, Thassa's Oracle is an enter the battlefield effect rather than a replacement effect, so with the correct setup you don't need to wait to draw a card. It is also cheaper to play at 2 mana rather than 3 or 4."

> "The biggest strength is even if they destroy Thassa's Oracle in response, it checks if your devotion is greater or equal to the number of cards in your deck."

## Recommendations

### Minimal Effort (Sultai)
**Teval, the Balanced Scale** — Per [CoolStuffInc 2025](https://www.coolstuffinc.com/a/juliansison-seo-04092025-the-top-5-sultai-commanders), Teval has "dethroned Muldrotha" for Sultai reanimator. You change 0-2 cards.

### Higher cEDH Viability (Sultai)
**Tasigur, the Golden Fang** — Your Consultation/Oracle package is already optimized. Per [EDHREC Commander Showdown](https://articles.edhrec.com/commander-showdown-muldrotha-vs-tasigur/), Tasigur is "far more similar to Thrasios" as a control/combo commander.

### Different Playstyle (Sultai)
**Yarok, the Desecrated** — Per [EDHREC Commander Showdown](https://articles.edhrec.com/commander-showdown-muldrotha-vs-yarok/), Yarok is "the hare" to Muldrotha's "tortoise." More explosive, less graveyard-dependent.

### Best Simic Option
**Tatyova, Benthic Druid** — Already in your sideboard. Per [EDHREC Nearly Identical](https://edhrec.com/articles/nearly-identical-tatyova-or-aesi), Tatyova and Aesi share 90% card overlap, so the shell is well-documented.

## Data Limitations & Honest Assessment

### What I Could Not Access Directly:
- EDHREC page data (403 blocked) — used search result snippets
- Moxfield primer full text (403 blocked) — used search result snippets
- TappedOut full decklists (403 blocked) — used search result snippets
- Actual synergy percentage scores from EDHREC

### What I Extrapolated vs. Cited:
- Card counts in your deck: **Manually counted from your list**
- "Cards changed" estimates: **Extrapolated based on strategy requirements from primers**
- Dollar cost estimates: **Not verified with current prices**

### Recommendations That Are My Analysis (Not Cited):
- The assessment that your deck is "already well-suited for Tasigur" is my conclusion based on your card choices matching what primers recommend
- The specific cards I flagged as "losing value" in each swap are logical inferences, not from primers
