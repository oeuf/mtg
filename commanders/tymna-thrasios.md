## Strategic Overview

Tymna the Weaver paired with Thrasios, Triton Hero represents the gold standard for dual-format midrange/value commanders. Often abbreviated as "TnT," this partnership dominated competitive EDH for years and remains the benchmark against which all other value commanders are measured. The pairing excels in both 1v1 Duel Commander and multiplayer precisely because it solves the fundamental resource disparity between formats: **card advantage in the command zone**.

### Why TnT Excels Across Both Formats

**Tymna the Weaver** (`1WB, Legendary Creature — Human Cleric`)
- Draw up to 3 cards per turn cycle based on opponents damaged by your creatures
- In 1v1: Consistently draws 1 card per turn with minimal investment (evasive 1-drops)
- In Multiplayer: Scales perfectly—damage 3 opponents, draw 3 cards, counteracting the 1:3 draw ratio
- Life payment is negligible in both formats (20 life vs. 40 life both allow 3-4 activations comfortably)

**Thrasios, Triton Hero** (`GU, Legendary Creature — Merfolk Wizard`)
- Activated ability: `2GU: Scry 1, then reveal top card. If land, put into play. Otherwise draw.`
- Mana sink that converts excess resources into card advantage at instant speed
- In 1v1: Closes games by chaining draws with infinite mana combos (Dramatic Reversal + Isochron Scepter)
- In Multiplayer: End-of-turn card draw every rotation, passive value accumulation
- Win condition: Infinite mana → deck yourself → Thassa's Oracle / Laboratory Maniac

### Core Strategic Identity

**1v1 Duel Commander Identity:**
- Aggressive midrange with card advantage backing
- Deploy evasive threats (Birds of Paradise, Noble Hierarch, etc.) to enable Tymna draws
- Thrasios provides late-game sink for excess mana
- Fast combo finish via Dramatic Scepter or Thoracle lines
- Interaction-heavy to protect combo and disrupt opponent's plan
- Turn 4-6 typical win window

**Multiplayer Identity:**
- Value-grinding control that appears innocuous early
- Tymna draws scale with opponents—the more players, the better she gets
- Political positioning: "I'll only attack you if you're the threat" creates alliances
- Slow-roll advantage until critical mass, then combo finish when opponents tapped out
- Thrives in longer games where resource accumulation matters
- Turn 6-8 typical winning position establishment

### Format-Specific Strategic Adjustments

**Format Continuity**: TnT's core strategy remains virtually identical between formats—maximize card advantage, control the board, assemble combo. This makes sideboarding minimal (10-12 cards).

**1v1 Adjustments:**
- More aggressive creature suite (evasive 1-2 drops for Tymna triggers)
- Higher density of instant-speed interaction (opponent's full attention on you)
- Faster combo assembly (turn 4-5 instead of turn 7-8)
- Commander protection more critical (facing focused removal)

**Multiplayer Adjustments:**
- Political creatures (opponents choose targets for damage → Tymna draws)
- Mass removal over single-target (Wrath of God handles 3 opponents' boards)
- Slower, more resilient combo assembly (navigate 3x interaction)
- Threat assessment tools (let opponents fight each other)

---

## Dual-Format Competitive Assessment

### 1v1 Duel Commander Performance: 9.5/10

**Strengths:**
- **Card Advantage Engine**: Tymna draws 1+ cards every turn with minimal setup (evasive 1-drop)
- **Fast Combo Finish**: Dramatic Scepter, Thoracle Consult, or Food Chain lines close by turn 4-5
- **Color Access**: GWUB covers all premium interaction, ramp, and tutors
- **Resilience**: Losing one partner doesn't cripple strategy; both function independently
- **Meta Position**: Proven tier 1 across all competitive 1v1 metas

**Weaknesses:**
- **Commander Tax**: 4 mana total for both partners adds up over multiple removals
- **Color-Intensive**: GWUB mana base requires fetches/duals/shocks for consistency at power 8-9
- **Combo-Dependent**: If disrupted repeatedly, can struggle to close without combo
- **Focus Fire**: Tymna draws immediate removal; expect her to die 2-3 times

**Key Matchups:**

| Matchup | Win Rate | Strategy |
|---------|----------|----------|
| vs. Fast Combo (Kinnan, Godo) | 65% | Race or disrupt with Force of Will, counter critical pieces |
| vs. Midrange (Tasigur, Zur) | 70% | Out-value via Tymna draws, superior card quality |
| vs. Aggro (Winota, Najeela) | 60% | Stabilize with removal, Tymna draws find answers |
| vs. Control (Rashmi, Teferi) | 55% | Grind advantage, force through combo with protection |

**Turn Clock**: Consistent turn 4-6 wins with Dramatic Scepter or Thoracle lines. Turn 3 possible with explosive opening (Mana Crypt, fast mana).

**Commander Tax Impact**: Moderate. Tymna at 5 mana (3WB) still playable; 7 mana (5WB) becomes inefficient. Thrasios tax less impactful (always mana sink).

### Multiplayer Performance: 9.5/10

**Strengths:**
- **Scalable Card Advantage**: Tymna draws 2-3 cards per turn rotation in 3-4 player pods (insane)
- **Political Leverage**: Attack selection creates deals ("I won't attack you if you don't wipe")
- **Late-Game Dominance**: Thrasios end-of-turn draws accumulate massive advantage
- **Interaction Volume**: 4 colors = access to all premium answers for 3 opponents
- **Combo Resilience**: Can assemble through 3x interaction with protection suite
- **Threat Profile**: Appears fair/friendly until explosive combo finish (political gold)

**Weaknesses:**
- **Early Archenemy Risk**: If opponents recognize TnT's late-game dominance, may focus-fire
- **4-Color Constraints**: Mana base damage from fetches/shocks adds up over long games (40 life is buffer)
- **Graveyard Hate**: Vulnerable to Rest in Peace, Leyline of the Void (hurts recursion)
- **Stax Vulnerability**: Tax effects (Sphere of Resistance, Thalia) slow combo assembly significantly

**Political Positioning:**
TnT's secret weapon in multiplayer: **appears fair while accumulating overwhelming advantage**.

- **Early Game (T1-4)**: Ramp, play innocuous value pieces (Rhystic Study, enchantments). Don't attack yet—let others build boards.
- **Mid Game (T5-8)**: Start Tymna triggers on LEAST threatening opponent ("I'm helping you by weakening Player A"). Draw 2-3 cards per rotation.
- **Late Game (T9+)**: Float to 2nd place in threat assessment. When 2+ opponents tapped out, combo finish with protection.

**Threat Trajectory**: Slow build from turns 1-6 (appears 3rd most threatening), spikes turn 7+ when card advantage converts to combo.

**Pod Size Preference**: 3-4 players optimal. At 5-6 players, game drags and archenemy dynamic harder to navigate.

### Format Comparison

**Which Format is Primary Strength?**
TnT is **perfectly balanced** between formats (9.5/10 both), but if forced to pick: **slight multiplayer edge** due to Tymna's scaling with opponent count.

**Performance Gap**: Minimal. TnT is the rare commander that translates 1:1 between formats with near-zero strategic adjustment.

**Why It Works in Both:**
1. Card advantage solves both 1v1 parity and multiplayer's 1:3 draw ratio
2. Combo finish viable at 20 life (1v1) and 120 total life (multiplayer)
3. Interaction density scalable (8-10 pieces in 1v1, 10-12 in multiplayer)
4. Political neutrality (appears fair, doesn't draw hate)

## Flexibility & Adaptation

### Primary Game Plans

**1v1 Gameplan vs. Opponent Archetypes:**

| Opponent Type | Strategy |
|---------------|----------|
| Fast Combo | Race with Dramatic Scepter or disrupt with Force of Will + Swords to Plowshares |
| Midrange | Out-value with Tymna draws, superior card quality |
| Aggro | Stabilize with removal, find board wipes, Tymna draws pull ahead |
| Control | Bait counters with redundant threats, force combo through with protection |

**Multiplayer Gameplan by Pod Composition:**

| Pod Type | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| 3x Aggro | Pillowfort early, let them fight each other, clean up survivors |
| 2x Aggro + 1 Control | Ally with control player, help suppress aggro, betray late-game |
| 2x Combo + 1 Midrange | Become "table police," disrupt combos, appear helpful, then combo |
| 3x Midrange | Grind value via Tymna/Thrasios, out-resource everyone, combo finish |

### Strategic Pivots

**When to Aggro vs. Control (1v1):**
- **Aggro Pivot**: Against slower decks (Atraxa, Ur-Dragon). Deploy threats early, pressure life total, Tymna draws fuel assault.
- **Control Pivot**: Against fast combo (Kinnan, Godo). Hold interaction, protect combo, don't overextend into wipes.
- **Decision Point**: Mulligan hands signal—creature-heavy = aggro, interaction-heavy = control.

**When to Race vs. Grind (Multiplayer):**
- **Race**: If 2+ opponents are combo decks (Kinnan, Najeela). Assemble combo by turn 6-7 before they do.
- **Grind**: If pod is midrange/value (Muldrotha, Chulane). Out-value via Tymna draws, close turn 9-10 when resources insurmountable.
- **Adaptation Signal**: Turn 4-5 board state—if opponents ahead, race. If you're ahead/equal, grind.

## Format-Specific Dynamics

### 1v1 Specific

**Racing Capability vs. Fast Decks**: 8.5/10
TnT can race with Dramatic Scepter (turn 4-5), but dedicated fast combo (Godo turn 3, Kinnan turn 4) are slightly faster. Relies on Force of Will to disrupt.

**Grinding Capability vs. Control**: 9.5/10
Tymna's repeatable card draw beats most control decks in resource war. Thrasios ensures no mana wasted end-of-turn.

**Commander Tax Mitigation**:
- Cast Tymna first (lower tax, critical for draws)
- Thrasios second (mana sink, higher tax acceptable)
- Protect Tymna with Mother of Runes, Giver of Runes
- Rebuild without commanders if necessary (deck functions independently)

### Multiplayer Specific

**Political Positioning**:
TnT's greatest multiplayer asset is **selective targeting**.

- Tymna triggers require combat damage → you choose who to attack
- Negotiate: "I'll attack Player A (the threat) if you don't counter my Rhystic Study"
- Never attack all 3 opponents—create temporary allies
- Thrasios is non-threatening (just draws cards, doesn't hurt anyone)

**Deal-Making Potential**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
- "I'll use Swords to Plowshares on Player C's commander if you don't attack me"
- "Let my Rhystic Study resolve and I'll help you stop the combo player"
- Tymna triggers = bargaining chip ("I won't attack you this turn")

**Archenemy Scenarios**:
If you become archenemy (too much card advantage drawn):
1. **Pivot to Politics**: "I'll draw you cards too" (cast group hug effects like Rites of Flourishing)
2. **Make Necessary Deal**: "Help me stop Player A's combo and I won't combo for 2 turns"
3. **Go for Broke**: If table is unified against you, assemble combo with maximum protection and hope for the best

**Mitigation**: Don't draw all Tymna triggers every turn—decline some draws to stay under radar. Paradoxical but effective.

- Multiplayer emphasizes Categories 2, 4, 8 (scaling value + board control)
- Categories 1, 6 remain constant (universal needs)

---

## Salt Level Analysis

**EDHREC Salt Score**: 7/10
**Format Breakdown**:
- **1v1 Salt**: 6/10 (combo finish is expected, Tymna draws seen as fair)
- **Multiplayer Salt**: 7/10 (Tymna draws feel oppressive over long games, combo finish from "do-nothing" deck frustrates)

**Salt Contributors**:
1. **Tymna Draws**: Drawing 2-3 cards per turn rotation while opponents draw 1 creates visible disparity (feels bad)
2. **Combo Finish**: "Where did that come from?" when you've been playing fair/political all game
3. **Color Access**: "You have all the best cards" (GWUB access to premium staples)
4. **Resilience**: "I killed your commanders 3 times and you still won" (frustrating for opponents)

**Salt Mitigation**:
- Explain Tymna triggers clearly ("I drew 2 extra cards because I attacked 2 players")
- Avoid excessive tutoring early (don't search every turn, too obvious)
- Political framing: "I'm helping you by attacking Player A"
- Diversify win conditions (don't always Thoracle Consult)

**Political Viability Despite Salt**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
TnT's political tools (attack selection) and friendly appearance ("just drawing cards") offset salt. Players often don't realize you're winning until it's too late.

## Dual-Format Deck Primer

### Mulligan Strategy

**1v1 Mulligan (Going First):**
- **KEEP**: 1-2 lands, 1-2 mana sources (dork/rock), interaction piece, threat
- **Greedy Keep**: 1 land + 3 mana sources if you have Brainstorm effects
- **Mulligan**: Slow hands (3+ lands, no acceleration), no interaction
- **Key Cards**: Turn 1 dork (Birds of Paradise) → Turn 2 Tymna is ideal curve

**1v1 Mulligan (Going Second):**
- **KEEP**: More flexible (extra draw compensates), can keep 2-land hands
- **Mulligan**: No interaction hands (opponent may combo turn 3-4)

**Multiplayer Mulligan:**
- **KEEP**: 2-3 lands, 1 ramp piece, flexible
- **Greedy Keep**: Acceptable in multiplayer—longer games allow slower starts
- **Mulligan**: 0-1 lands (mull to 5 if necessary for functional hand)
- **Key Cards**: Rhystic Study in opening hand is near auto-keep

**Format-Dependent Keeps:**
- **1v1**: Mulligan aggressively for fast hands (to 5-6 acceptable)
- **Multiplayer**: Keep slower hands (ramp + value engine), patience rewarded

---

### Gameplan by Format

#### 1v1 Duel Commander Gameplan

**Early Game (T1-3): Tempo & Setup**

- **Turn 1**: Fetch, dork (Birds of Paradise) or mana rock (Sol Ring)
- **Turn 2**: Tymna + hold interaction (if dork T1), or 2-drop rock + cantrip
- **Turn 3**: Thrasios or value piece (Rhystic Study), keep mana for interaction

**Interaction Priorities Early:**
- Counter opponent's mana acceleration (Sol Ring, Mana Crypt)—levels playing field
- Remove critical commanders (Godo, Kinnan)—disrupts their gameplan
- DON'T counter small value pieces (save for combo)

**Mid Game (T4-6): Advantage & Pressure**

- **With Tymna in Play**: Attack with dork/evasive creature, draw 1 card per turn
- **Without Tymna**: Grind with Rhystic Study, Mystic Remora until card advantage established
- **Combo Setup**: Tutor for Dramatic Scepter or Thoracle Consult by turn 4-5

**When to Apply Pressure vs. Defend:**
- **Pressure**: If opponent is durdle deck (Atraxa, no interaction), deploy threats and race
- **Defend**: If opponent is combo (Kinnan, Godo), hold Force of Will and wait for their all-in turn

**Resource Management:**
- Tymna draws → find answers + combo pieces
- Thrasios activation → use excess mana end-of-turn (no waste)
- Don't overextend into wipes—rebuild with card advantage

**Closing (T5-7): Finishing**

**Win Condition Deployment:**
1. **Dramatic Scepter**: Cast Isochron Scepter, imprint Dramatic Reversal, generate infinite mana → Thrasios activations until Thoracle + win
2. **Thoracle Consult**: Cast Demonic Consultation exiling library, cast Thassa's Oracle, win
3. **Ad Nauseam**: Cast Ad Nauseam, draw deck (low curve = minimal life loss), combo same turn

**Protection Sequence:**
- Hold Force of Will for opponent's interaction on your combo turn
- Cast Silence before combo (opponent can't interact)
- Bait counters with lesser threats, then combo when clear

**When to Overextend vs. Play Safe:**
- **Overextend**: If opponent tapped out or you have protection (Force of Will in hand)
- **Safe**: If opponent has open blue mana and you don't have counter backup

---

#### Multiplayer Gameplan

**Early Game (T1-4): Ramp & Development**

- **Turn 1-2**: Ramp (dork, rock), don't deploy Tymna yet (draws hate)
- **Turn 3**: Cast value engine (Rhystic Study, Mystic Remora)—appears fair/friendly
- **Turn 4**: Deploy Tymna ONLY if:
  - You can protect her (Mother of Runes)
  - Opponents are busy fighting each other
  - You're behind (appears non-threatening)

**When to Interact vs. When to Ramp:**
- **Interact**: Only if threat affects YOU directly or is game-ending combo
- **Ramp**: Default action—let opponents fight, you accumulate resources

**Reading Pod Speed:**
- **Fast Pod** (turn 5-6 wins): Prioritize combo assembly, hold protection
- **Slow Pod** (turn 8-10 wins): Grind value, Tymna draws, out-resource everyone

**Building Political Capital:**
- "I'll Swords to Plowshares Player A's commander if you don't attack me next turn"
- "Let my Rhystic Study resolve and I'll help you stop Player C's combo"
- Attack selection: Hit the MOST threatening opponent → others see you as ally

**Mid Game (T5-8): Value Accumulation & Politics**

**Value Engine Deployment:**
- Tymna triggers: Attack 2 opponents (avoid attacking ally), draw 2 cards
- Thrasios: End-of-turn activation on EVERY opponent's turn (3x draws per rotation)
- Rhystic Study: 3 opponents = 3 triggers per rotation → massive card advantage

**Threat Assessment Across 3 Opponents:**

| Opponent Threat Level | Your Action |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Player A: Ahead, building combo | Use removal/counters, convince others to focus them |
| Player B: Mid-threat, value engine | Ignore unless combo-ing |
| Player C: Behind, rebuilding | Don't waste removal, let them recover (shield from Player A) |

**When to Make Deals/Alliances:**
- **Necessary Deal**: When you're archenemy—negotiate "I won't combo for 2 turns if you leave me alone"
- **Strategic Alliance**: Partner with 2nd-place player to suppress 1st place, then betray when advantageous

**Managing Threat Profile:**
- **Turns 1-6**: Stay 3rd in threat assessment (build quietly)
- **Turns 7-8**: Acceptable to be 2nd (resources accumulated)
- **Turn 9+**: Spike to 1st when combo-ing (unavoidable, but by then too late for opponents)

**Interaction Priorities (Triage):**
- **Always Counter**: Game-winning combos from ANY opponent
- **Sometimes Counter**: Powerful permanents that snowball (e.g., Doubling Season in Atraxa)
- **Never Counter**: Small value pieces from non-threatening opponents (save resources)

**Late Game (T9+): Timing & Closing**

**Finding Windows:**
- **Optimal Window**: 2+ opponents tapped out (post-combat main phases)
- **Acceptable Window**: 1 opponent with interaction, but you have protection (Force of Will)
- **Suboptimal**: All opponents with open mana (bait first, then combo on crack-back)

**Closing Against 120 Total Life:**
- Infinite mana combos scale perfectly (Dramatic Scepter → Thoracle)
- Life totals irrelevant with instant-win combos (Thoracle Consult)

**Dealing with "Everyone Teams Up":**
- **Prevention**: Don't become archenemy until winning turn
- **Mitigation**: Make deals ("I'll scoop to Player A if you don't counter me now"—risky but viable)
- **Force Through**: Maximum protection suite (Force of Will, Pact of Negation, Silence)

**Backup Plans When Primary Disrupted:**
1. **Combo Pieces Exiled**: Grind with Tymna/Thrasios card advantage, find alternate combo (Ad Nauseam)
2. **Graveyards Exiled**: Doesn't matter—combo is library-based (Thoracle Consult)
3. **Commanders Removed**: Continue with deck's independent value (Rhystic Study, Tutors)

**Line 3: Patient Accumulation (Turn 8)**
```
T1-3: Ramp, cast Rhystic Study
T4-6: Tymna attacks (draw 2-3 cards per rotation), Rhystic Study triggers (3 opponents = 3+ draws)
T7: Assembled 15+ cards in hand from draws, tutor for combo pieces
T8: 2 opponents tapped out post-wipes, cast Dramatic Scepter with Force of Will backup → win
```

**Line 4: Ad Nauseam Finish (Turn 7)**
```
T1-5: Build value engines (Tymna, Rhystic), appear non-threatening
T6: Opponents at 30-35 life (combat damage), you at 40 life
T7: Cast Ad Nauseam (reveal ~25 cards, lose 15 life), find Thoracle Consult
→ Cast Demonic Consultation (exile library), cast Thoracle, win
```

### Format-Specific Interaction Priorities

**1v1 Interaction Triage:**

| Opponent Card | Counter? | Why/Why Not |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Sol Ring T1 | Maybe | Levels playing field, but uses your counter (save for combo?) |
| Opponent's Commander (Kinnan, Godo) | Yes | Disrupts their primary gameplan |
| Value Engine (Rhystic Study) | No | Not immediately threatening, race value with Tymna |
| Combo Piece (Dramatic Reversal) | YES | Game-ending if resolves |
| Board Wipe (Wrath of God) | Maybe | If you're ahead and Tymna in play, counter. Otherwise rebuild. |

**Multiplayer Interaction Triage:**

| Situation | Counter? | Political Framing |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Player A casts game-winning combo | YES | "I'm saving the table, you're welcome" (builds capital) |
| Player B casts Rhystic Study | No | Let it resolve, you benefit from opponent draws too |
| Player C casts board wipe | Maybe | "If you don't wipe, I won't attack you" (negotiate first) |
| Player A attacks you with 10 power | Counter with Ghostly Prison | "I told you attacking me was expensive" |

**Letting Opponents Fight:**
- **Best Scenario**: Players B and C fight over threat, you're 3rd in assessment
- **Your Action**: Don't intervene, accumulate card advantage via Tymna/Thrasios
- **When to Step In**: Only if winner of their fight becomes unstoppable

## Performance Analysis

### 1v1 Duel Commander Performance

**Best Matchups: 65-70% Win Rate**
- **Midrange (Tasigur, Muldrotha)**: Tymna draws out-value their recursion, superior card quality
- **Aggro (Winota, mono-red)**: Stabilize with removal, card advantage pulls ahead
- **Control (Rashmi, Teferi)**: Grind value, force combo through protection suite

**Worst Matchups: 50-55% Win Rate**
- **Fast Combo (Godo, Kinnan)**: Turn 3-4 wins are faster than TnT's turn 4-6 clock, relies on Force of Will
- **Stax (GAAIV, Derevi)**: Tax effects slow combo assembly, Tymna draws taxed heavily
- **Graveyard Hate (RIP decks)**: Doesn't hurt TnT much (library-based combo), but limits recursion

**Key Sideboard Transitions for 1v1:**
- **vs. Fast Combo**: Bring in Veil of Summer, Autumn's Veil (protect combo)
- **vs. Control**: Bring in Carpet of Flowers (ramp vs. blue), Dockside (mana)
- **vs. Aggro**: Keep mass removal (Toxic Deluge), add Ghostly Prison

**Win-Con Viability at 20 Life:**
- Dramatic Scepter → Thoracle: Infinite combo ignores life total (perfect)
- Thoracle Consult: Instant win regardless of life (perfect)
- Ad Nauseam: Low curve = ~15 life loss, leaves buffer at 20 life (good)

### Multiplayer Performance

**Best Pod Compositions: 70-75% Win Rate**
- **3x Midrange (Chulane, Muldrotha, Roon)**: Grind value, superior card advantage wins long game
- **2x Aggro + 1 Control**: Let aggro pressure control, ally with control to survive, betray late
- **Mixed Power Levels**: TnT stomps lower-power pods (power 7-8), appears fair until combo

**Worst Pod Compositions: 50-55% Win Rate**
- **3x Fast Combo (Kinnan, Godo, Najeela)**: Racing is difficult, relies on disrupting all 3
- **3x Stax (GAAIV, Derevi, Zur)**: Tax effects slow TnT's combo, Tymna draws expensive
- **Experienced Players (all cEDH)**: Meta-aware opponents recognize TnT threat, focus-fire early

**Optimal Seat Position:**
- **Going Last (4th)**: Best position—see all opponents' plays before acting, Tymna triggers after everyone developed
- **Going First**: Acceptable—fastest ramp, but less information

**Political Positioning Strategy:**
- **Turns 1-4**: Ramp, appear friendly, don't deploy threats
- **Turns 5-7**: Tymna triggers on most threatening opponent, negotiate with others
- **Turns 8+**: Combo when 2+ opponents tapped out, use protection if needed

**Win-Con Viability at 120 Total Life (40x3):**
- Infinite combos scale perfectly—no life total relevance (excellent)
- Thoracle Consult: Instant win (perfect)
- Ad Nauseam: 40 life buffer allows drawing entire deck (perfect)

### Weakness Mitigation

**1v1: Handling Bad Matchups**

**vs. Fast Combo:**
- Mulligan aggressively for Force of Will or Pact of Negation
- Prioritize disruption over value early (counter their Sol Ring)
- Accept trading resources 1-for-1 to slow them (they're faster, must disrupt)

**vs. Stax:**
- Play through tax effects (Tymna at 5 mana is expensive but playable)
- Tutor for artifact removal (Nature's Claim for Sphere of Resistance)
- Grind value via Tymna draws until combo assembled despite taxes

**Racing vs. Grinding Decision:**
- **Race**: If opponent is slower (Atraxa, 5-color goodstuff)
- **Grind**: If opponent is control (you win resource war with Tymna)

**Multiplayer: Surviving Focus-Fire**

**If Archenemy Too Early:**
1. **Make Necessary Deals**: "I won't combo for 2 turns if you leave me alone"
2. **Pivot to Support**: Help suppress actual threat (Player A with combo)
3. **Rebuild Quietly**: Don't cast Tymna, grind with Rhystic Study instead

**Threat Profile Management:**
- Decline Tymna triggers sometimes (don't draw all 3 cards—appear less threatening)
- Don't tutor every turn (too obvious, draws hate)
- Cast group hug effects (Rites of Flourishing) to appear friendly

**Universal: Recovering from Commander Removal**

**Tymna Removed 3 Times (9 mana):**
- Don't recast—9 mana is prohibitive
- Pivot to independent value (Rhystic Study, Thrasios only)
- Tutors find win conditions (Ad Nauseam) without Tymna

**Thrasios Removed 3 Times (8 mana):**
- Acceptable to recast—mana sink remains valuable even at 8 mana
- Focus on Tymna draws, Thrasios is backup

**Backup Plans:**
- Deck functions without commanders (tutors, value engines)
- Combo pieces don't require commanders (Thoracle Consult independent)
- Rhystic Study carries games alone in multiplayer

---

## Final Verdict

**Tymna + Thrasios is the #1 dual-format midrange/value commander for good reason**: elite card advantage in both formats, infinite flexibility, proven meta dominance, and near-perfect format translation with minimal sideboarding.

**Build This If:**
- You want the best dual-format performer (9.5/10 both formats)
- You value competitive viability above all (cEDH tier 1)
- You enjoy political gameplay and decision-intensive magic
- You have or can acquire a 4-color mana base (fetches, duals, shocks)

**Skip This If:**
- You hate combo finishes (TnT relies on Thoracle/Dramatic Scepter)
- You want low-salt gameplay (TnT draws hate in multiplayer)
- Budget is primary concern (4-color mana base is expensive)
- You prefer linear strategies (TnT requires complex decision-making)

**Recommended Build Order**: #1 if you want best dual-format performance, #2-3 if you prefer simpler strategies (Kinnan) or lower salt (Tasigur).
