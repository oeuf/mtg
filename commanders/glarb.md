# Glarb, Calamity's Augur

**Rank**: #57 Overall | **Colors**: BUG (Sultai)
**Strategy**: Lands Matter + Top Deck Manipulation + Reanimator Hybrid

---

## Strategic Overview

Glarb, Calamity's Augur is a 3-mana 2/4 Sultai commander that combines top-deck manipulation with surveil synergies. At just 3 mana, Glarb deploys much faster than Muldrotha (turn 2-3 vs turn 6), allowing you to start generating value immediately. The surveil 2 tap ability fills your graveyard while the second ability lets you play lands and cast expensive spells (4+ mana value) directly from the top of your library.

### Why This Build Reuses Muldrotha Cards

**Shared Color Identity (Sultai)**
Both commanders use BUG colors, so ALL mana base, ramp, interaction, and tutors transfer directly.

**Surveil = Self-Mill Synergy**
Glarb's surveil ability fills your graveyard just like Muldrotha wants. Cards like:
- Buried Alive, Entomb, Satyr Wayfinder (self-mill engines)
- Fetchlands (graveyard fuel + deck thinning)
- Hermit Druid, Millikin (mill enablers)

All work perfectly for Glarb's strategy while being core Muldrotha pieces.

**Lands Matter Overlap**
Muldrotha's land recursion package transfers beautifully:
- **Sakura-Tribe Elder**: Ramp that fuels graveyard
- **Wood Elves**: Land ramp that works with landfall
- **Fetchlands**: Multiple uses with Glarb's land-from-top ability
- **Crucible of Worlds**: Replay lands from graveyard
- **The Gitrog Monster**: Draw engine with land recursion

**Reanimator Bridge: Eye of Duskmantle**
This is the KEY card that bridges both strategies! Eye of Duskmantle lets you pay 2 life to cast spells from your graveyard that you surveilled away. This means:
- Glarb surveils big spells to graveyard → Eye casts them for 2 life
- Works with Muldrotha's reanimation targets (big creatures, combo pieces)
- Enables playing both "top deck" AND "graveyard" strategies simultaneously

### Core Strategy: Triple Threat Value Engine

**Early Game (Turns 1-3): Deploy & Setup**
- Turn 1-2: Ramp (Birds of Paradise, Sol Ring, Mana Crypt)
- Turn 2-3: Deploy Glarb (3 mana vs Muldrotha's 6 = much faster)
- Turn 3+: Start surveiling, play extra lands, set up value engines

**Mid Game (Turns 4-7): Value Accumulation**
- Tap Glarb every turn to surveil 2 (manipulate top deck + fill graveyard)
- Play multiple lands per turn using landfall enablers
- Cast big spells (4+ mana) for free from top of library
- Use Eye of Duskmantle to cast surveilled cards from graveyard

**Late Game (Turns 8+): Domination**
- Overwhelming land advantage (8-12 lands while opponents have 5-7)
- Cast massive spells for free or from graveyard
- Combo finish or value dominance

## Key Cards to ADD for Glarb (10-15 cards)

These cards are CRITICAL for Glarb and not in typical Muldrotha builds:

### Essential Glarb Synergies
1. **Eye of Duskmantle** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - THE bridge card. Pay 2 life to cast surveilled spells from graveyard. This lets you use both top-deck AND graveyard strategies.

2. **Conduit of Worlds** - Play lands from graveyard (like Crucible) but for all permanents. Redundancy for land recursion.

3. **Tatyova, Benthic Druid** - Draw + life when lands enter. Critical for lands matter strategy.

4. **Scapeshift** - Sacrifice all lands, find all your best utility lands + fetchlands. Massive value with landfall.

5. **Splendid Reclamation** - Return all lands from graveyard to battlefield. Game-ending with landfall triggers.

6. **Rampaging Baloths** - Landfall creates 4/4 beasts. Win condition in lands matter build.

7. **Avenger of Zendikar** - Creates army of plant tokens based on land count. Win condition.

8. **Field of the Dead** - Create 2/2 zombies when lands enter if 7+ differently named lands.

9. **Ancient Greenwarden** - Double landfall triggers + play lands from graveyard.

10. **Ramunap Excavator** - Another Crucible of Worlds effect.

### Big Spells to Cast from Top (4+ mana value)
11. **Tooth and Nail** - Tutor 2 creatures, put into play. Classic combo enabler.

12. **Consecrated Sphinx** - Draw engine, 4+ mana for Glarb's ability.

13. **Koma, Cosmos Serpent** - Giant threat, 4+ mana.

14. **Jin-Gitaxias, Progress Tyrant** - Counter spells, copy your spells, 4+ mana.

15. **Vilis, Broker of Blood** - Draw when you lose life (synergizes with Eye of Duskmantle!).

## Why This Build is FUN

3. **Lower Salt**: No obvious graveyard lock like Muldrotha's repetitive loops
4. **Explosive Turns**: Play 3-4 lands in one turn with landfall triggers everywhere
5. **Flexibility**: Can pivot between lands matter, reanimator, or big spell strategies
6. **Budget Friendly**: Reuses 65+ cards from Muldrotha, minimal new acquisitions

## Cards to Swap OUT from Muldrotha

These Muldrotha-specific cards don't work well for Glarb:

❌ **Seal of Primordium** - Muldrotha recursion loop, not needed for Glarb
❌ **Seal of Removal** - Same reason
❌ **Caustic Caterpillar** - Muldrotha-specific sacrifice loop
❌ **Spore Frog** - Muldrotha fog lock, not relevant for Glarb
❌ **Lion's Eye Diamond** - Muldrotha combo piece, doesn't work from top of library
❌ **Brain Freeze** - Muldrotha storm combo, not Glarb's strategy
❌ **Walking Ballista + Mikaeus** - Muldrotha combo, not Glarb's win condition
❌ **Eternal Witness** - Better in Muldrotha for loops, less critical for Glarb
❌ **Archaeomancer** - Same as Witness
❌ **Skullwinder** - Muldrotha recursion loop

**Total Cards to Remove**: ~10-12 Muldrotha-specific combo/recursion pieces
